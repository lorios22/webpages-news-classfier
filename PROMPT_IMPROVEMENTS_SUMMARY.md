# ðŸš€ Prompt Improvements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the AI agents' prompts to address the three main quality issues identified in the analysis without changing the system architecture.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problems Addressed

### 1. Structure Problems (Scores 4.0-5.0)
**Issues:**
- Poorly organized articles without clear headers
- Disorganized information flow
- Inadequate formatting affecting readability

**Solutions Implemented:**
- âœ… Enhanced Structure Analyzer with specific formatting checks
- âœ… Added readability factors evaluation
- âœ… Improved visual hierarchy assessment
- âœ… Specific structural issue identification
- âœ… Actionable improvement suggestions

### 2. Insufficient Context (Scores 5.0-6.0)
**Issues:**
- Lack of technical term explanations
- Assumes prior reader knowledge
- Insufficient background information provided

**Solutions Implemented:**
- âœ… Enhanced Context Evaluator with technical term checking
- âœ… Added background information requirements
- âœ… Improved reader accessibility assessment
- âœ… Missing context identification and suggestions
- âœ… Contextual completeness evaluation

### 3. Limited Depth (Scores 3.0-5.5)
**Issues:**
- Superficial analysis in some cases
- Lack of technical implications exploration
- No deep dive into underlying mechanisms

**Solutions Implemented:**
- âœ… Enhanced Depth Analyzer with technical complexity focus
- âœ… Added analytical depth and research quality checks
- âœ… Improved practical implications assessment
- âœ… Mechanism explanation requirements
- âœ… Multi-factor impact assessment

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Improvements

### Structure Scores (4.0-5.0 â†’ 6.0-7.0)
- Better identification of organizational issues
- More specific formatting recommendations
- Enhanced readability assessment

### Context Scores (5.0-6.0 â†’ 6.5-7.5)
- Improved technical term evaluation
- Better background information assessment
- Enhanced reader accessibility analysis

### Depth Scores (3.0-5.5 â†’ 5.0-7.0)
- More rigorous technical complexity evaluation
- Better mechanism explanation requirements
- Enhanced analytical depth assessment

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Test the Enhanced Pipeline**
   ```bash
   python3 run_enhanced_pipeline.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Score Improvements**
   - Watch for higher structure scores
