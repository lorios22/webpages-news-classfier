Here is why:Market makers are long gammaOptions market makers are long gamma at strikes from 120,000 and 130,000 according to activity on Deribit tracked by Amberdata. Most of that is concentrated in the July 25, Aug. 1 and Aug. 29 expiries.It means that market makers will likely buy low and sell high within that range to balance their net exposure to neutral, arresting the price volatility. That could keep prices rangebound, assuming other things are equal. A similar dynamic likely played out early this month, maintaining prices tethered to the 108,000-110,000 range for some time.BTC options: Cumulative Dealer gamma and expire wise breakup. (AmberdataDeribit)DVOL upswingBitcoins bull run from 70,000 to 122,000 is characterized by a breakdown in the historical positive correlation between the spot price and Deribits DVOL, which measures the 30-day implied or expected price turbulence. In other words, the DVOL has been trending lower throughout the price rally in a classic Wall Street-like dynamics.However, DVOL seems to have found a bottom at around annualized 36 since late June. Moreover, applying technical analysis indicators like the MACD to the DVOL suggests the index could soon turn higher, and it could mean a correction in BTCs price, considering the two variables are now negatively correlated.DVOL (TradingView)DXY ends downtrendThe dollar index, which tracks the greenbacks value against major currencies, has bounced nearly 17 to 97.00 this month. The recovery has penetrated the downtrend line, representing the sell-off from early February highs.The breakout indicates the end of the downtrend. This comes as potential U.S. sanctions on countries buying Russian oil could lift energy prices, a positive outcome for the energy-independent U.S. and the USD, as ING said in a note to clients Monday.Accelerated recovery in the DXY could cap upside in the dollar-denominated assets like BTC and gold.DXY. (TradingView)AIs take: When options market makers are long gamma, it means their delta(directional exposure)increases as the price moves in their favor and decreases when it moves against them. This typically leads to a stabilizing effect on price: as BTC rises towards 130,000 market makers will sell some BTC to maintain their delta-neutral positions, and if it dips towards 120,000 theyll buy. This can create a pinning effect, keeping BTC within that 120,000-130,000 range, especially as the July and August expiries approach.Resistance: 130,000, 140,000, 146,000.Support:118,800, 116,650, 112,000.ETH: Still stuck in an expanding triangleDespite the 22 month-to-date gain, ETH remains stuck in an expanding channel, identified by trendlines connecting May 13 and June 11 highs and lows hit on May 18 and June 22.As of writing, prices pushed against the upper trendline, but the probability of a convincing breakout looked blea",

It's an unprecedented alignment of bullish BTC factors.\n\nBTC's daily chart shows no signs of popular indicators like the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) diverging bearishly and major averages, 50-, 100- and 200-day simple moving average (SMAs) remain stacked bullishly one above the other on daily and intraday charts.\n\nWatch out for a breakout in the cumulative open interest in BTC perpetual futures listed on offshore exchanges as an additional bullish development.\n\nOverall, prices appear on track to test 130,000 the upper end of the ascending parallel channel drawn off April 9 and June 22 lows and the high on May 22. That said, we could be in for consolidation between 120,000 and 130,000 for some time.

In other words, the DVOL has been trending lower throughout the price rally in a classic Wall Street-like dynamics. However, DVOL seems to have found a bottom at around annualized 36 since late June. Moreover, applying technical analysis indicators like the MACD to the DVOL suggests the index could soon turn higher, and it could mean a correction in BTC's price, considering the two variables are now negatively correlated.\n\n### DXY ends downtrend\n\nThe dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, has bounced nearly 17 to 97.00 this month. The recovery has penetrated the downtrend line, representing the sell-off from early February highs. The breakout indicates the end of the downtrend. This comes as potential U.S. sanctions on countries buying Russian oil could lift energy prices, a positive outcome for the energy-independent U.S. and the USD, as ING said in a note to clients Monday.

As of writing, prices pushed against the upper trendline, but the probability of a convincing breakout looked bleak.",

The breakout above $0.200 resistance was confirmed by back-to-back volume spikes of $615.53M and $581.80M during the 03:00-04:00 session. Institutional accumulation was visible as volume exceeded the 24H average ($268.45M) throughout late trading. Futures volume reached $1.50B, driven by multiple $1M transactions across major derivatives venues.\n\nNews Background\n\nDOGE's breakout coincided with a broader crypto uptrend led by easing Fed rate expectations and a thaw in BRICS-U.S. trade tensions. Derivatives market activity surged, with DOGE futures open interest and volume reaching their highest levels this month. Whale-led flows dominated on-chain metrics, while traders took aim at $0.213-$0.215 as the next resistance cluster. Bitcoin's new all-time high of $118,000 provided risk-on momentum across meme and altcoin sectors.\n\nPrice Action Summary\n\n- Range: $0.01  Low: $0.200  High: $0.210\n- Breakout Time: 03:00-04:00, peak volume at $615.53M\n- Support: $0.200 (22:00 session, volume $296.12M)\n- Resistance: $0.208-$0.210 into session close\n- Final Hour (04:05-05:04): DOGE climbed from $0.200 to $0.210\n- Key Spike: 04:47 breakout, volume $26.32M confirmed final lift above $0.21\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nDOGE broke through key resistance at $0.200 with triple-digit million volume. High-conviction buyers defended $0.200 through retracement attempts. Late-session move showed sustained demand with no sharp sellback into close. Overall trend: rising volume, higher lows, momentum into close - bullish continuation setup. Next resistance zones: $0.213 (prior rejection point), then $0.218-$0.220.\n\nWhat Traders Are Watching\n\n- Does DOGE hold above $0.208-$0.210? Consolidation here may signal base-building for a push to $0.215.\n- Breakdown below $0.198 invalidates bullish structure.\n- Watch futures OI and whale wallets for confirmation of trend extension or exit flows.\n\nTakeaway\n\nDOGE's late-session breakout was clean, real, and institutional. With volume crossing $615M and futures activity spiking, meme coin flows are no longer retail-led. $0.200 is the new base and bulls are now watching for a $0.213 breakout.

XRP's market cap increased by 30B, securing the 3 spot in global crypto rankings.\n\nWhat to know:\n- XRP rose 6.04% from 2.77 to 2.93 between July 13 06:00 and July 14 05:00, with a 0.171 range and clear breakout through the 2.84 resistance level.\n- Institutional accumulation appeared at 03:00, when trading volume spiked to 176M—double the hourly average—confirming breakout strength.\n- XRP closed above 2.91 despite intra-session profit-taking, with final-hour consolidation indicating a healthy cooldown.\n- Market cap now stands at 163.98B after a 30B weekly addition, pushing XRP to the 3 spot in global crypto rankings.\n\nNews Background\n\nXRP's rally follows a clean break from a multi-session descending triangle pattern, with sustained institutional flows confirming renewed market interest. Analysts cite improving regulatory signals and Ripple's expanding enterprise adoption as catalysts for inflows, while broader crypto markets remain supported by softening macro policy expectations and favorable capital markets conditions. With the 2.84 zone cleared and held, momentum traders now eye the 3.40 level as the next major resistance zone.\n\nPrice Action Summary\n- Range: 0.171  Low: 2.77  High: 2.934\n- Breakout Time: 03:00 hour with 176M volume\n- Support Zone: 2.77 (early session); 2.91-2.92 (late session hold)\n- Resistance: 2.934 intraday; 3.40 projected next\n\nFinal Hour (04:05-05:04):\n- XRP rose from 2.927 to 2.930 (0.11)\n- Hourly Volume: 85M during final session, confirming sustained interest\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nXRP broke out above 2.84, confirming a descending triangle breakout. Price held above 2.91 throughout final hour, forming a tight consolidation band. Structure remains bullish with rising higher lows and sustained volume. Volume-led breakout and follow-through indicate institutional support. If XRP can clear 2.94-2.95 cleanly, 3.10 and 3.40 open as next upside targets.\n\nWhat Traders Are Watching\n\nCan XRP flip 2.934 into support and extend rally toward 3.10-3.40? Watch for downside tests of 2.91; a breakdown there could invite a move toward 2.84 retest. Volume remains key: continued 100M hourly volume signals institutional follow-through.\n\nTakeaway\n\nXRP's 6% rally isn't just technical—it's capital-backed. Volume at the 2.84 breakout zone confirms large-buyer participation, while price action into the close shows composure. As the market now eyes the 3.40 breakout target, XRP continues to trade like a leader, not a laggard.",

Zanker announced upcoming projects including a TRUMP mobile game and praised Justin Sun's efforts to expand the TRUMP token's reach.\n\nJustin Sun, facing SEC charges, is working on a resolution while continuing to support the TRUMP token's integration with Tron. Bill Zanker, who helped U.S. President Donald Trump and his family launch the eponymous NFT collection and memecoin, says there's more to come from their collaborations. Zanker says he's still in good graces with the president's family despite receiving a cease-and-desist from it just weeks ago.\n\n\"Every day, we're focused on turning TRUMP into a practical tool for engagement and mainstream adoption,\" Zanker told CoinDesk in an interview via Telegram organized by Tron. \"Stay tuned for a TRUMP Mobile Game coming soon and many other big things this summer.\"\n\nZanker might be seen as on the outs with the Trump family after cease-and-desist letters reportedly accused him of misusing the Trump name to promote a crypto wallet tied to the controversial TRUMP token, a project the family says it never authorized.\n\nThis project is not authorized by Trump.\n\n\"I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization,\" Eric Trump tweeted on June 3, 2025.\n\nHowever, Zanker told CoinDesk that this is not the case. \"No dispute, just a big misunderstanding,\" he told CoinDesk via Telegram. Both parties are still working together, and Zanker pointed to a recent announcement from World Liberty Financial that it was adding the TRUMP token to its treasury as proof that all is well.\n\n\"It ended up that World Liberty was in advanced stages of their wallet,\" he continued. \"We felt it would be best for them to launch with it.\"\n\nZanker also sang the praises of Tron's Justin Sun in the interview organized by Sun's team. Sun recently announced that the TRUMP token is coming to Tron, via bridging technology provided by LayerZero.\n\n\"Justin's focus is about building real, usable infrastructure,\" he said. \"He's incredibly driven, and he listens. He has always pushed to make blockchain technology more accessible to the non-crypto audience TRUMP attracts, and making crypto useful for people around the world. I respect his focus and the results he continues to deliver,\" Zanker continued.\n\nSun, for his part, still faces civil fraud charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged he and Tron engaged in market manipulation and issued unregistered securities. His attorneys and the SEC asked a court to pause the case to work on a possible resolution, a similar motion the SEC made in other cases it ultimately dropped. The parties face a late-August deadline to file an update.",

(TungArt7Pixabay)What to know:BTC and ETH traders bet big through onchain and centralized options markets.Tuesdays U.S. inflation data is likely to show price pressure likely accelerated in June.BTCs bull run, however, is led by factors other than low inflation and high Fed rate cut bets.Traders are betting big on bitcoinBTC121,918.41and ether(ETH)as the BTC rally rages on, and observers downplay Tuesdays U.S. inflation data as a potential barrier for the bull.BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, rose to record highs above 121,000 during Mondays Asian trading hours, representing a 2.7 gain on a 24-hour basis. The new high took the year-to-date gain to nearly 30, with prices up 13 this month alone, according to CoinDesk data.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Ether followed suit, rising 3 to near 3,050, and other major coins such as XRPXRP2.9715, DogecoinDOGE0.2071, BNB(BNB), and Solanas SOL(SOL)boasted 3 to 5 gains.Activity on the leading decentralized options platform Derive backed the bullish price action, with significant open interest concentrated in the 130,000 call option.Almost 20 of the open interest on Derives Sept 26 expiry for BTC is concentrated at the 130K call, suggesting traders expect gradual but persistent price rises over the next three months, Nick Forster, founder at Derive, said.In ETHs case, 45 of ETHs open interest on the July 18 expiry is concentrated in the 3,400 strike, with that one strike making up 16 of ETH weekend volume, Forester explained, calling that a sign of traders expecting a breakout in the second-largest cryptocurrency.While volatility remains moderate compared to 2020-21, directional conviction is growing, especially in ETH. Were watching closely for confirmation of this trend over the coming week, Forster noted.Options listed on centralized giant Deribit painted a similar bullish picture for bitcoin and ether, with calls or bullish bets trading pricier than puts across tenors.Inflation a non-eventThe main event of this weeks macro calendar is the U.S. consumer price index(CPI)inflation data due Tuesday.According to FactSet, the June CPI is forecast to have risen 0.23 on the month, amounting to a 2.6 annualized growth,up fromMays 2.4. The annualized core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, likely rose 3.Both traditional and crypto market investors have closely watched it for the past four years, as it heavily influences the Federal Reserves interest rate decisions.However, this time, the crypto market may not be impacted, according to the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub. They believe fiscal profligacy, a rising global money supply, and a soft U.S. dollar are driving the ongoing bull market and not the Fed rate cuts story.We dont think it matters. Were still in a Goldilocks macro environment with a slowing, not collapsing US economy and whilst inflation remains a little sticky, its not accelerating to a point that would change the direction of travel at the Fed from rate cuts to hikes. Meanwhile, the weaker dollar continues to feed into easy financial conditions and is helping facilitate the expansion in global money supply, the founders told CoinDesk.They added that with the Trump administration doing a complete 180 on deficit reduction, we are back running the fiscal dominance playbook of the Biden era.Moreover, President Donald Trumps big beautiful tax bill, which recently passed in Congress, is projected to add over 3 trillion to the already record-high national debt over time.So the drivers for risk and bitcoin are currently not dominated by expectations for Fed rate cuts, but this fiscal dominance story, rising global money supply, alongside a softer dollar. Therefore, Sensitivity to the Fed and, by extension, the CPI data is much reduced, the founders told CoinDesk.Crypto week and corporate adoptionThis week, dubbed as the Crypto Week by the Trump administration, could see the House of Representatives debate several crypto bills, including the Genius Act, Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.Positive developments on these fronts are likely to insulate bitcoin and the wider crypto market from macro developments. The relentless corporate adoption of bitcoin also helps.The bitcoin market is moving quite strongly due to demand from my corporate treasuries and associated speculation. In addition, this week has been dubbed crypto week by the Trump admini",

The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy, is forecast to have risen 0.3 monthly and 3 on an annualized basis.Risk assets, including BTC, may wobble a bit if inflation accelerates, delaying the Fed rate cut. That said, the downside could be limited given the strong momentum in terms of corporate adoption of BTC, ETF inflows and positive regulatory outlook in the U.S.According to John Glover, CEO of Ledn, BTCs rally has legs and prices could rise to 136,000 by the year-end.We have finally broken to new highs, which confirms that the dip to 96k in late June satisfied the wave(ii)pullback(yellow line)within the larger Wave 5(orange line), Glover said in an email.While this doesnt change the ultimate target of circa 136k to complete this bull run, it does likely reduce the time it will take to complete.

Heres whats making news in the markets:Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, seeCoinDesks Crypto Daybook Americas.Rest in Peace, Coinbase Wallet.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.No, the app itself isnt going away, but it is getting a new name.(Coinbase X Profile)On its X profile, its name is crossed out and replaced with a TBA and a few question marks.Theres plenty of speculation about what it means, but Im leaning toward The Base App. That would fit the idea of Base unveiling a range of in-app experiences directly inside its wallet, Bradley Park, a Seoul-based analyst with DNTV Research, told CoinDesk in an interview.Base Creator Jesse Pollak wastapped to lead Coinbases Wallet team last October, which lends credence to Parks theory.In an interview on the sidelines of Devcon in Bangkok last year,Pollak played up the decentralization of Base. It could be that the wallet is due for a rebrand to highlight its decentralized nature and distance from Coinbase itself.Its not the first time Coinbase has re-branded its wallet. Originally it was launched as Toshi, and in2018 that name was droppedin favor of Coinbase Wallet.Ethereums ZK Upgrade Earns Institutional Praise from Cathie WoodARK Invest CEO Cathie Woodsays Ethereumis proposing the right moves for scalability and privacy to maintain its lead in the institutional world, as theEthereum Foundation unveils a roadmap to bring zero-knowledge proofs(ZKPs)directly to its base layer.While Wood acknowledged she does not grasp all the technical details, her endorsement highlights growing institutional confidence in Ethereums long-term vision.The proposed upgrade would let validators verify cryptographic proofs of block validity rather than re-executing each transaction, dramatically reducing computational overhead. These proofs would be generated by block builders or third-party zk-prover networks and verified in under 10 seconds, using hardware that costs less than 100,000 and consumes no more than 10 kilowatts of power.The plan would boost network throughput and decentralization, but comes with tradeoffs. Shifting the burden of computation from validators to provers could introduce liveness risks if those provers go offline or collude. The Ethereum Foundation aims to mitigate these risks through prover diversity, protocol hardening, and eventually enabling at-home participants to contribute to proving.If successful, this would make Ethereum the first major blockchain to integrate ZKPs at the protocol layer, reinforcing its position as the dominant infrastructure for both decentralized applications and institutional adoption.

This is especially true if the concessions involve trading partners lowering their tariffs on U.S. products, wrote Commerzbank analysts in a morning note.However they also flagged a downside to the U.S. dollar being the high uncertainty facing U.S. companies as they face potential tariffs at any time, and the impact on their willingness to invest.Reaction in the currency market to Trumps latest tariff threats was largely muted, though the euro did slip to a roughly three-week low early in the session.The single currency later regained some ground and last traded 0.1 lower at 1.168175.Elsewhere, sterling was down 0.1 to 1.3475, while the Japanese yen rose marginally to 147.33 per dollar.Against the Mexican peso, the dollar rose 0.3 to 18.683.Investors have grown increasingly desensitised to Trumps slew of tariff threats, with his latest upheaval in the global trade landscape doing little to prevent U.S. stocks from scaling record highs and offering just a slight boost to the dollar.It seems like financial markets have become insensitive to President Trumps tariff threats now, after so many of them in the past few months, said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.Story ContinuesJudging by the limited market reaction, markets might think that the latest threat from Trump is actually a manoeuvre to extract more concessions.In other currencies, the Australian dollar fell 0.11 to 0.65665, while the New Zealand dollar slid 0.36 to 0.5988.Outside of tariff news, Trump on Sunday said that it would be a great thing if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stepped down, again threatening to undermine the central banks independence as he called for interest rates to be lowered.Traders could get a better clue on the future path for U.S. rates when inflation data for June comes due on Tuesday, where expectations are for U.S. consumer prices to have picked up slightly last month.Markets are currently pricing in just over 50 basis points worth of Fed easing by December.In Asia, data on Monday showed Chinas exports regained momentum in June while imports rebounded, as exporters rushed out shipments to capitalise on a fragile tariff truce between Beijing and Washington ahead Trumps August deal deadline.(Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Ros Russell)TermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

I think that frames the whole approach... in this move to active management.On average, wealth funds made returns of 9.4 last year, the joint second-best performance in the surveys history.Nevertheless, market volatility and de-globalisation concerns have spiked - and over the 10-year horizon, big worries centre around climate change and rising sovereign debt levels.Over 70 of the 58 central banks polled said rising U.S. debt is negatively impacting the dollars long-term outlook. Two thirds said they are looking to build larger, more diversified reserves to manage volatility.Nevertheless, 78 think it will take more than two decades for a credible alternative to the greenback to emerge. That is a jump from 58 last year while just 11 of central banks now view the euro as gaining ground compared to 20 last year.CHINA FOMOThe survey was carried out between January and March - before U.S. President Donald Trumps Liberation Day tariff announcements and at the peak of excitement around DeepSeek AIs emergence in China.Wealth funds are seeing a major resurgence in interest in Chinese assets with nearly 60 intending to increase allocations there in the coming five years, specifically the tech sector.That number jumps to 73 in North America despite the worsening U.S.-Sino tensions, whereas in Europe it sits at just 13.Wealth funds, the survey said, were now approaching Chinas innovation-driven sectors with the strategic urgency they once directed toward Silicon Valley.Theres a little bit of a FOMO, Ringrow explained, a view that I need to be in China now as it shapes up to be a global leader in semiconductors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and renewable energy.Story ContinuesPrivate credit has also emerged as a key focus for funds seeking alternative sources of income and resilience. It is now adopted by 73 of wealth funds, up from 65 last year, and with half actively increasing allocations.This represents one of the most decisive trends in sovereign asset allocation, the report said.There is also growing interest, especially among emerging market wealth funds, in stablecoins - a type of cryptocurrency that is most commonly pegged 1:1 to the dollar.Almost half of funds said stablecoins were the type of digital assets they were inclined to invest in, although that was still behind the likes of bitcoin, where the share was 75.(Reporting by Libby George; Editing by Hugh Lawson)TermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

Despite warnings of complacency from the likes of JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, investors have so far behaved as if theyre counting on the US president to back down, having seen previous U-turns from his administration.Investors shouldnt bank on Trump only bluffing with the 30 tariff threat on EU goods, Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, wrote in an email. That level of tariffs is punitive, but it likely hurts them more than the US, so the clock is ticking.Currency markets suggested risk appetite is beginning to wane, with the dollar and Japanese yen edging higher against most Group-of-10 peers in early trading while the Australian dollar and euro led losses. The euro touched its strongest level against the dollar since 2021 this month as investors assessed the regions relative growth prospects.

Unless there is a major course correction, the U.S. should brace for a financial crisis leading up to congressional midterm elections next year, he warned.The world is losing faith in the dollar, and the U.S. could suffer a financial crisis next year, according to Desmond Lachman, a former deputy director of the International Monetary Funds Policy Development and Review Department.In aProject Syndicatecolumnon Monday, he noted that the U.S. fiscal situation was already shaky before President Donald Trump began his second term.But his tax cuts in the megabill that was just signed into law will add trillions to the deficit. Meanwhile, his tariffs and pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates have further weakened confidence in the dollar by stoking inflation concerns, Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, explained.Add to that Trumps apparent disregard for the rule of law, and markets see little reason to trust the US, he added.In his view, thats why the dollar sank 10 against other top global currencies in the first half of the year, marking the greenbacks worst such performance since 1953.The plunge came despite the tariffs and the wider premium between U.S. rates and those of other top economies, which would normally boost the dollar.Golds surge of more than 25 this year is another sign of collapsing market confidence in the U.S., as is Treasury yields remaining elevated despite market turbulence, Lachman said.That all adds up to a very clear vote of no confidence from financial markets in the Trump administrations economic policies.The problem for Trump is that, unlike politicians, markets cannot be pressured or primaried, he said, referring to the threat of ousting disobedient lawmakers via primary elections. If he refuses to heed investors warnings, as seems likely, the US should brace for a dollar and bond-market crisis in the run-up to next years midterm elections. The days of the world letting America live beyond its means are rapidly coming to an end.To be sure, many on Wall Street have been sounding alarms about tariffs, inflation, widening deficits, unsustainable debt, the dollar and demand for U.S. Treasuries.But so far, tariffs havefailed to trigger a spike in inflation, while the revenue collected from the duties is on pace to reach 300 billion this year.La historia continúaAnd despite warnings that bond vigilantes will express displeasure with fiscal policies by demanding higher yields on bonds, that has yet to materialize. In fact, recent Treasury auctions have shown there remains healthy demand for U.S. debt, for now.In addition, many analysts see the dollar retaining its status as the worlds primary reserve currency despite attempts to push alternatives.John Queen, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group, said in arecent notethat bond markets are adapting to higher debt levels, adding that the interest rate market is incredibly efficient at pricing in risks.While he is concerned about the size of the debt and its impact on borrowing costs, its unknown when those worries will become reality.Many people have predicted that catastrophe is right around the corner and, someday, one of them is going to be right, Queen wrote.

      "description": "The dollar is the most important currency on earth, adding up to 57.7% of global currency reserves in the first quarter.",
      "content": "On January 3, JPMorgan Asset Managementwrotethat, heading into 2025, the United States dollar had defied gravity.Despite three Federal Reserve interest rate cuts last year, the greenback rallied 7 in 2024. (Lower rates often make the dollar less attractive to investors, who look for better returns in other currencies.)We have since learned that a lot can change in six months. The US currency just completed its worst first-half return in 52 years, falling 10.8 through the end of June. In 1973, Richard Nixon was in office, and it was still five years before Christopher Reeve, never mind David Corenswet, would play Superman.Through its resilient run last year, the dollar had advantages. The US economy outpaced its developed nation peers. Other central banks, looking to stimulate growth, embarked on their own, more aggressive rate-cutting sprees, and the end of 2024 saw the biggest gap between the US 10-year bond yield and the equivalent of its key trading partners since 1994, JPMorgan noted.But nothing lasts forever, the banks analysts were quick to note, flagging that the dollar has alternated between periods of strength and weakness, making a downturn likely at some point. Thats proven the case in 2025; the question now is whether the greenback can, like the Man of Steel, defy gravity again or if, amid a wave of tariff uncertainty including levies on steel, theres still a significant downside to come.What a Buck is WorthWhy this all matters is pretty straightforward. The dollar is the most important currency on earth, accounting for 57.7 of global currency reserves in the first quarter, a slight decrease of about 10 basis points from the end of 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). So, when something happens to the dollar, something happens toalmost everything else.Yeah, the cost of that 1.20 morning espresso on the Roman holiday you have booked next month has crept up all year. That weakened international purchasing power can also bite at home: For example, a weak dollar means it costs more to import oil, which can increase gas prices at the pump and pinch your wallet even if you opt against a Roman holiday.But there can be an upside for some: Many US multinational companies (and with them, shareholders) can benefit from the weak dollar because their revenues denominated abroad are converted back to a softened greenback, good for the bottom line. A classic example is McDonalds, which hashistoricallydonewell with a weaker dollar (thoughnot this yearso far, as US consumers have turned sour on eating out due to economic worries).Oil giant Schlumberger madenearly80 of its revenue from international markets last year. Georgia-headquartered insurance company Aflac is one of the largest insurers in Japan and makes roughly 60 of its revenue from that market (the yen has gained more than 6 against the dollar this year).The weak dollar can also be good for shareholders of foreign companies, which benefit from a currency advantage when converting to buy items denominated in dollars. In a May report, Trivariate Research identified 16 periods since 2001 when the dollar weakened 5 or more, and found the median performance of US equities was a rise of 7.5 during those periods. That was the sixth-worst performance among 55 regions the firm evaluated, with the best performers being equities in Greece (up 17.6), Indonesia (up 17.5), and Peru (up 16.4).The Source of the Gravitational PullThe dollar sell-off, which has driven the currency to its lowest point since March 2022, has been tied to two very prominent things that youve read 15 Tolstoy novels worth about already this year: the radical realignment in US economic policies under a new administration, coupled with growing concerns about the US 36 trillion national debt and ballooning deficits.Both of these factors have raised doubts about the traditional safe-haven role of dollar-denominated assets. On-and-off tariff warring, in addition to panicking markets in April, has dragged US growth forecasts lower. In April, the IMFslashedits projection for US GDP growth in 2025 to 1.8 from 2.7, the steepest downgrade among developed countries.Meanwhile, deficit concerns led Moodys todowngradeUS government debt in May, which led the country to lose its last perfect credit rating. (Thats also related to why US bond yields have climbed, flashing investor worries about the sustainability of Americas mounting debt.)The US dollar is the most notable loser so far this year as it has lost 10 against other currencies, with investor concerns regarding Trumps policies having weighed on the greenback, wrote analysts at Unicredit.Theres also evidence to show institutions are building up defensive fortifications elsewhere: Central banks have ramped up their purchases of gold, a key dollar alternative, to 27 tons per month as of May,accordingto the World Gold Council.
