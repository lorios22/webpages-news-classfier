"If Trump actually manages to extract significant concessions from U.S. trading partners by threatening them with tariffs, this could be seen as positive for the dollar."

Description: World shares were mixed on Monday as investors focused on tariffs and corporate earnings updates.  An announcement over the weekend by U.S. President Donald Trump that he plans 30% tariffs on goods from Mexico and the European Union had a modest immediate impact, as analysts said they expected progress toward trade deals before an Aug. 1 deadline.  Trump detailed the planned tariffs Saturday in letters posted to his social media account.

Description: It looks increasingly clear that for President Trump, tariffs are mainly a convenient means of dominating the news cycle and staying in the headlines.  Not for him are months of tortuous, complex trade talks aimed at a win-win outcome.  Why do that when you can tweet a 30% tariff threat on a Saturday morning and own the news for an entire weekend?

Description: Dollar demand from foreign banks and a large local corporation, alongside tepid risk appetite amid lingering uncertainty on U.S. trade policies, drove the rupee lower to a closely watched support level on Monday.  Asian currencies were mostly weaker, while the dollar index was hovering just shy of the 98 mark.  President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose a 30% tariff on imports from Mexico and the European Union starting on August 1, adding them to a list of countries that have received letters from the U.S. declaring country-specific levies.

Description: SINGAPORE (Reuters) -The euro briefly hit a three-week low on Monday before partially recovering, while the dollar gained marginally after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 30% tariff on imports from two of the largest U.S. trading partners from August 1.  Analysts pointed to the so-called TACO (Trump always chickens out) trade as keeping a cap on any bigger moves in forex markets.  Trump on Saturday announced the latest tariffs in separate letters to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that were posted on his Truth Social media site.

Description: LONDON (Reuters) -The world's sovereign wealth funds are turning to active fund management and investments in China, while central banks are diversifying reserves to weather a volatile global environment, an Invesco survey of sovereign funds and central banks managing $27 trillion in assets showed.  Still, the dollar reigns supreme, with the bulk of central banks saying it would take two decades to dethrone it - if ever - as the top reserve currency despite growing concerns.  "Institutions with greater than $100 billion - so the pretty large institutions - those are the ones that were most interested in moving more to active management," said Rod Ringrow, Invesco's head of official institutions.
