By allowing Revolut users to confirm crypto purchases with biometric ID or a passcode, it eliminates some of the common friction points faced by crypto buyers, particularly the card declines and identity verification delays that can disrupt transactions.\n\nRevolut Pay, introduced as a direct-from-account payment feature for online checkouts, comes with built-in fraud protection and instant transaction processing. The integration will extend to all of MoonPay's 500-plus partner platforms, including popular wallets and decentralized apps.\n\nIvan Soto-Wright, CEO of MoonPay, framed the move as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto. Integrating Revolut Pay into MoonPay means millions of Revolut users can now buy crypto with the payment method they already trust and use every day, he said in a statement.\n\nFor end users, the update means faster onboarding and smoother repeat transactions. For MoonPay's partner platforms, the addition of a widely adopted European payment method could help cut drop-off rates at checkout and broaden crypto's retail base in regulated markets. The change highlights a growing trend as crypto services tap into mainstream fintech payment infrastructure, aiming to normalize digital asset purchases for everyday consumers.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

Most of that is concentrated in the July 25, Aug. 1 and Aug. 29 expiries.It means that market makers will likely buy low and sell high within that range to balance their net exposure to neutral, arresting the price volatility.

(AmberdataDeribit)DVOL upswingBitcoins bull run from 70,000 to 122,000 is characterized by a breakdown in the historical positive correlation between the spot price and Deribits DVOL, which measures the 30-day implied or expected price turbulence. In other words, the DVOL has been trending lower throughout the price rally in a classic Wall Street-like dynamics.However, DVOL seems to have found a bottom at around annualized 36 since late June.

(TradingView)AIs take: When options market makers are long gamma, it means their delta(directional exposure)increases as the price moves in their favor and decreases when it moves against them.

This can create a pinning effect, keeping BTC within that 120,000-130,000 range, especially as the July and August expiries approach.Resistance: 130,000, 140,000, 146,000.Support:118,800, 116,650, 112,000.ETH: Still stuck in an expanding triangleDespite the 22 month-to-date gain, ETH remains stuck in an expanding channel, identified by trendlines connecting May 13 and June 11 highs and lows hit on May 18 and June 22.As of writing, prices pushed against the upper trendline, but the probability of a convincing breakout looked blea\n                    Source: coindesk\n                    Published: Mon, 14 Jul 2025 08:29:40 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    ', 'analysis': {'url': 'https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/14/bitcoin-may-consolidate-in-120k-130k-here-are-3-reasons-why/', 'metadata': {'title': 'Bitcoin May Consolidate in $120K-$130K, Here are 3 Reasons Why', 'author': 'Omkar Godbole', 'date': '2025-07-14', 'word_count': 1038}, 'cleaned_content': "Bitcoin May Consolidate in $120K-$130K, Here are 3 Reasons Why\n\nBTC's dealer gamma profile suggests potential consolidation.\n\n### Bitcoin: Looks north; Dealer gamma, Vol and DXY in focus\n\nBitcoin BTC 121,918.41 just shattered records, surging past 123,000 early Monday, continuing the march to 140,000 levels indicated by the strong breakout in BlackRock's IBIT last week.\n\nThere's every reason to be incredibly bullish here as we face a Goldilocks moment for bitcoin: a pro-crypto U.S. President calling for ultra-low interest rates against the backdrop of fiscal splurge and stock market highs.

If macroeconomic conditions hold and bitcoin stabilizes above  120,000, further upside in large-cap altcoins appears likely in the coming weeks,traders opine.With the U.S. kicking off Crypto Week in Congress, a series of hearings aimed at making America the crypto capital of the world, traders are positioning for legislative tailwinds.Crypto prices benefited from the major melt-up fervor with BTC trading up to the high 118K area, liquidating over 1 billion in shorts, said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message.Market sentiment is likely to stay frothy into the summer, with the only real risk catalyst being a complete breakdown of tariff negotiations, but the ball is sitting with the President on how aggressive he wants to push his current hand, Fan added.Strong on-chain support at 109,000, along with cross-asset flows from equities into digital assets, is giving bulls more confidence.

Ether surpassed 3,000, driven by significant ETF inflows, while other major tokens like XRP and Solana also saw gains. U.S. legislative developments and macroeconomic conditions are influencing market sentiment, with potential for further price increases.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) 121,918.41 extended its breakout to a new all-time high of 122,000 on Monday, triggering a broad crypto rally as ETF inflows, short liquidations, and policy optimism from Washington continued to buoy a bullish mood. Ether (ETH) broke through 3,000, supported by 383 million in ETF inflows on Friday. Major tokens have surged in the past week amid BTC's strength.\n\nXRP (XRP) trading near 2.95, up 30% on a weekly basis, Solana's SOL reclaiming the 167 level, and Dogecoin (DOGE) 0.2071 jumping over 20%, fueled by retail rotations and memecoin chatter. This mirrors patterns observed in previous cycles, where a BTC rally acts as a liquidity unlock for the broader market. If macroeconomic conditions hold and Bitcoin stabilizes above 120,000, further upside in large-cap altcoins appears likely in the coming weeks, traders opine.\n\nWith the U.S. kicking off Crypto Week in Congress, a series of hearings aimed at making America the crypto capital of the world, traders are positioning for legislative tailwinds. Crypto prices benefited from the major melt-up fervor with BTC trading up to the high 118K area, liquidating over 1 billion in shorts, said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message.\n\nMarket sentiment is likely to stay frothy into the summer, with the only real risk catalyst being a complete breakdown of tariff negotiations, but the ball is sitting with the President on how aggressive he wants to push his current hand, Fan added. Strong on-chain support at 109,000, along with cross-asset flows from equities into digital assets, is giving bulls more confidence. As Eugene Cheung, CCO at OSL, put it: The trend remains bullish. We could see Bitcoin test 130K-150K by year-end if macro winds cooperate.\n\nMeanwhile, equity-index futures in the U.S. and Europe retreated early Monday after Trump announced a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico, escalating trade tensions that had already rattled Brazil, Algeria, and Canada last week.

Trading volume spiked to 176M at 03:00, confirming the strength of the breakout. XRP's market cap increased by 30B, securing the 3 spot in global crypto rankings.\n\nWhat to know:\n- XRP rose 6.04% from 2.77 to 2.93 between July 13 06:00 and July 14 05:00, with a 0.171 range and clear breakout through the 2.84 resistance level.\n- Institutional accumulation appeared at 03:00, when trading volume spiked to 176M—double the hourly average—confirming breakout strength.\n- XRP closed above 2.91 despite intra-session profit-taking, with final-hour consolidation indicating a healthy cooldown.\n- Market cap now stands at 163.98B after a 30B weekly addition, pushing XRP to the 3 spot in global crypto rankings.\n\nNews Background\n\nXRP's rally follows a clean break from a multi-session descending triangle pattern, with sustained institutional flows confirming renewed market interest. Analysts cite improving regulatory signals and Ripple's expanding enterprise adoption as catalysts for inflows, while broader crypto markets remain supported by softening macro policy expectations and favorable capital markets conditions. With the 2.84 zone cleared and held, momentum traders now eye the 3.40 level as the next major resistance zone.\n\nPrice Action Summary\n- Range: 0.171  Low: 2.77  High: 2.934\n- Breakout Time: 03:00 hour with 176M volume\n- Support Zone: 2.77 (early session); 2.91-2.92 (late session hold)\n- Resistance: 2.934 intraday; 3.40 projected next\n\nFinal Hour (04:05-05:04):\n- XRP rose from 2.927 to 2.930 (0.11)\n- Hourly Volume: 85M during final session, confirming sustained interest\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nXRP broke out above 2.84, confirming a descending triangle breakout. Price held above 2.91 throughout final hour, forming a tight consolidation band. Structure remains bullish with rising higher lows and sustained volume. Volume-led breakout and follow-through indicate institutional support. If XRP can clear 2.94-2.95 cleanly, 3.10 and 3.40 open as next upside targets.\n\nWhat Traders Are Watching\n\nCan XRP flip 2.934 into support and extend rally toward 3.10-3.40? Watch for downside tests of 2.91; a breakdown there could invite a move toward 2.84 retest. Volume remains key: continued 100M hourly volume signals institutional follow-through.\n\nTakeaway\n\nXRP's 6% rally isn't just technical—it's capital-backed. Volume at the 2.84 breakout zone confirms large-buyer participation, while price action into the close shows composure. As the market now eyes the 3.40 breakout target, XRP continues to trade like a leader, not a laggard.", 'technical_elements': {'code_blocks': [], 'charts': [], 'diagrams': []}, 'related_links': []}}

The new high took the year-to-date gain to nearly 30, with prices up 13 this month alone, according to CoinDesk data.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Ether followed suit, rising 3 to near 3,050, and other major coins such as XRPXRP2.9715, DogecoinDOGE0.2071, BNB(BNB), and Solanas SOL(SOL)boasted 3 to 5 gains.Activity on the leading decentralized options platform Derive backed the bullish price action, with significant open interest concentrated in the 130,000 call option.Almost 20 of the open interest on Derives Sept 26 expiry for BTC is concentrated at the 130K call, suggesting traders expect gradual but persistent price rises over the next three months, Nick Forster, founder at Derive, said.In ETHs case, 45 of ETHs open interest on the July 18 expiry is concentrated in the 3,400 strike, with that one strike making up 16 of ETH weekend volume, Forester explained, calling that a sign of traders expecting a breakout in the second-largest cryptocurrency.While volatility remains moderate compared to 2020-21, directional conviction is growing, especially in ETH. Were watching closely for confirmation of this trend over the coming week, Forster noted.Options listed on centralized giant Deribit painted a similar bullish picture for bitcoin and ether, with calls or bullish bets trading pricier than puts across tenors.Inflation a non-eventThe main event of this weeks macro calendar is the U.S. consumer price index(CPI)inflation data due Tuesday.According to FactSet, the June CPI is forecast to have risen 0.23 on the month, amounting to a 2.6 annualized growth,up fromMays 2.4. The annualized core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, likely rose 3.Both traditional and crypto market investors have closely watched it for the past four years, as it heavily influences the Federal Reserves interest rate decisions.However, this time, the crypto market may not be impacted, according to the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub. They believe fiscal profligacy, a rising global money supply, and a soft U.S. dollar are driving the ongoing bull market and not the Fed rate cuts story.We dont think it matters. Were still in a Goldilocks macro environment with a slowing, not collapsing US economy and whilst inflation remains a little sticky, its not accelerating to a point that would change the direction of travel at the Fed from rate cuts to hikes. Meanwhile, the weaker dollar continues to feed into easy financial conditions and is helping facilitate the expansion in global money supply, the founders told CoinDesk.They added that with the Trump administration doing a complete 180 on deficit reduction, we are back running the fiscal dominance playbook of the Biden era.Moreover, President Donald Trumps big beautiful tax bill, which recently passed in Congress, is projected to add over 3 trillion to the already record-high national debt over time.So the drivers for risk and bitcoin are currently not dominated by expectations for Fed rate cuts, but this fiscal dominance story, rising global money supply, alongside a softer dollar. Therefore, Sensitivity to the Fed and, by extension, the CPI data is much reduced, the founders told CoinDesk.Crypto week and corporate adoptionThis week, dubbed as the Crypto Week by the Trump administration, could see the House of Representatives debate several crypto bills, including the Genius Act, Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.Positive developments on these fronts are likely to insulate bitcoin and the wider crypto market from macro developments. The relentless corporate adoption of bitcoin also helps.The bitcoin market is moving quite strongly due to demand from my corporate treasuries and associated speculation.

Almost 20% of the open interest on Derive\'s Sept 26 expiry for BTC is concentrated at the 130K call, suggesting traders expect gradual but persistent price rises over the next three months, Nick Forster, founder at Derive, said.\n\nIn ETH\'s case, 45% of ETH\'s open interest on the July 18 expiry is concentrated in the 3,400 strike, with that one strike making up 16% of ETH weekend volume, Forster explained, calling that a sign of traders expecting a breakout in the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile volatility remains moderate compared to 2020-21, directional conviction is growing, especially in ETH. "We\'re watching closely for confirmation of this trend over the coming week," Forster noted.\n\nOptions listed on centralized giant Deribit painted a similar bullish picture for bitcoin and ether, with calls or bullish bets trading pricier than puts across tenors.\n\n**Inflation a non-event**\n\nThe main event of this week\'s macro calendar is the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation data due Tuesday. According to FactSet, the June CPI is forecast to have risen 0.2% on the month, amounting to a 2.6% annualized growth, up from May\'s 2.4%. The annualized core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, likely rose 3%.\n\nBoth traditional and crypto market investors have closely watched it for the past four years, as it heavily influences the Federal Reserve\'s interest rate decisions. However, this time, the crypto market may not be impacted, according to the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub. They believe fiscal profligacy, a rising global money supply, and a soft U.S. dollar are driving the ongoing bull market and not the Fed rate cuts story.\n\n"We don\'t think it matters. We\'re still in a Goldilocks macro environment with a slowing, not collapsing US economy and whilst inflation remains a little sticky, it\'s not accelerating to a point that would change the direction of travel at the Fed from rate cuts to hikes. Meanwhile, the weaker dollar continues to feed into easy financial conditions and is helping facilitate the expansion in global money supply," the founders told CoinDesk.\n\nThey added that with the Trump administration doing a complete 180 on deficit reduction, we are back running the fiscal dominance playbook of the Biden era. Moreover, President Donald Trump\'s big beautiful tax bill, which recently passed in Congress, is projected to add over $3 trillion to the already record-high national debt over time.\n\nSo the drivers for risk and bitcoin are currently not dominated by expectations for Fed rate cuts, but this fiscal dominance story, rising global money supply, alongside a softer dollar. Therefore, sensitivity to the Fed and, by extension, the CPI data is much reduced, the founders told CoinDesk.\n\n**Crypto week and corporate adoption**\n\nThis week, dubbed as the Crypto Week by the Trump administration, could see the House of Representatives debate several crypto bills, including the Genius Act, Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Positive developments on these fronts are likely to insulate bitcoin and the wider crypto market from macro developments. The relentless corporate adoption of bitcoin also helps.\n\nThe bitcoin market is moving quite strongly due to demand from my corporate treasuries and associated speculation. In addition, this week has been dubbed crypto week by the Trump administration.', 'technical_elements': {'code_blocks': [], 'charts': [], 'diagrams': []}, 'related_links': []}}

These proofs would be generated by block builders or third-party zk-prover networks and verified in under 10 seconds, using hardware that costs less than 100,000 and consumes no more than 10 kilowatts of power.The plan would boost network throughput and decentralization, but comes with tradeoffs. Shifting the burden of computation from validators to provers could introduce liveness risks if those provers go offline or collude. The Ethereum Foundation aims to mitigate these risks through prover diversity, protocol hardening, and eventually enabling at-home participants to contribute to proving.If successful, this would make Ethereum the first major blockchain to integrate ZKPs at the protocol layer, reinforcing its position as the dominant infrastructure for both decentralized applications and institutional adoption. Combined with cheaper data availability via blobs and advances in zk-rollups, Ethereum is positioning itself as the chain most ready for scale.Market Movements:BTC:Bitcoin rallied 1 to nearly 119K over the weekend amid triple-normal trading volumes, while BlackRocks IBIT crossed 80 billion in crypto assets under management, signaling strong institutional demand despite a late-session profit-taking reversal.ETH:Ethereum surged past 3,000 for the first time since February, rising 3 amid record institutional inflows and heightened trading volumes that signaled strong bullish momentum.Gold:Gold climbed to 3,371 as central banks continue their historic accumulation spree, over 1,000 tonnes annually since 2022, fueling a bullish breakout above key technical levels and setting sights on 3,578 and beyond.Nikkei 225:Asia-Pacific markets opened lower Monday as investors reacted to President Trumps surprise weekend announcement of 30 tariffs on the EU and Mexico starting August 1, with Japans Nikkei 225 falling 0.33.Elsewhere in Crypto:Chart of the Week: Hyperbitcoinization May Not Be Just Maximalist Fantasy Anymore(CoinDesk)State of Crypto: Previewing Congress Crypto Week(CoinDesk)Coinbase hires pseudonymous poster AlexOnchai\n                    Source: coindesk\n                    Published: Mon, 14 Jul 2025 01:28:37 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    ', 'analysis': {'url': 'https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/14/asia-morning-briefing-how-will-coinbase-rebrand-its-wallet/', 'metadata': {'title': 'Asia Morning Briefing: How Will Coinbase Rebrand Its Wallet?', 'author': 'Sam Reynolds', 'date': 'Jul 14, 2025', 'word_count': 835}, 'cleaned_content': "Coinbase's A New Day One event is set to highlight where Base is going in the era of memecoins and it all starts with a wallet rebrand.\n\n### What to know:\n- Coinbase Wallet is undergoing a rebrand, with speculation suggesting it may be renamed The Base App to emphasize decentralization.\n- Ethereum's proposed ZK upgrade has received praise from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood for its potential to enhance scalability and privacy.\n- Bitcoin and Ethereum saw significant price increases, driven by strong institutional demand and heightened trading volumes.\n\nGood Morning, Asia.

(nopparitGetty Images)What to know:Bitcoin is trading at record highs, and major institutions are increasingly investing in it, suggesting a shift towards potential hyperbitcoinization.The concept of hyperbitcoinization is gaining traction beyond crypto enthusiasts, with discussions about national bitcoin reserves and cryptos role in financial infrastructure.The ownership of bitcoin is shifting from individuals to companies and governments, indicating a potential move towards a bitcoin-dominated economy.Hyperbitcoinization  an almost apocalyptic term evoking end-of-days fiat collapse and bitcoins parabolic rise to global reserve status  is increasingly being discussed in more serious circles.For hardcore bitcoin maximalists, its long been the ultimate scenario: a financial utopia where individuals, institutions and even nations are all-in on a bitcoin-only system as the fiat-based economy collapses.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.While we arent there yet, the recent events might suggest something is brewing.Bitcoin is trading atrecord highsabove119,000. The market cap of bitcoin isnear that of the tech giants. The U.S. dollar is continuing its slow bleed in real purchasing power.

For hardcore bitcoin maximalists, it's long been the ultimate scenario: a financial utopia where individuals, institutions, and even nations are all-in on a bitcoin-only system as the fiat-based economy collapses.\n\nWhile we aren't there yet, the recent events might suggest something is brewing. Bitcoin is trading at record highs above 119,000. The market cap of bitcoin is near that of the tech giants. The U.S. dollar is continuing its slow bleed in real purchasing power. Major institutions are allocating capital to BTC with the same risk-adjusted lens they apply to traditional assets.

In a recentinterviewon CNBC, Fundstrat Capital CIO Thomas Lee said that the demand versus supply imbalance for BTC meant that its price could easily reach anywhere from 150,000 to 250,000 by the end of this year.As of 4:11 p.m. UTC, bitcoin is trading at around 118,882, having risen 1.38 in the past 24 hours.Meanwhile, on the same day, XLM rose as high 0.4815(at 3:20 p.m. UTC), but currently it is trading at 0.4578, up 22 in the past 24 hours. XLMs performance, although highly impressive, was not a huge shock since on Saturday, it surged 6 to 0.3880, outperforming the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap.As for HBAR, its intraday high of 0.2516 was reached at 3:10 p.m. UTC, but it is currently trading at around 0.2439, up 27 in the past 24 hours, which makes it right now todays top percentage gainer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies.Altcoin rotationCrypto analyst Rekt Capitalnotedon X that HBARs recent 62 surge aligns closely with its 2021 price cycle, suggesting the token could be setting up for a similar breakout pattern. According to the analyst, HBAR has been tracking the 2021 structure almost perfectly, and any near-term pullback should be viewed as a potential retest with the goal of breaking above the current lower high resistance level.The pseudonymous analyst alsopointed outthat a modest 2.5 dip in bitcoins market dominance has already fueled strong rallies across many altcoins. He noted that if such a small decline can trigger outsized altcoin moves, a more substantial drop in dominance  into double-digit territory could significantly accelerate capital rotation into the altcoin market.BitcoinbtcXLMhbarSiamak MasnaviSiamak Masnavi is a researcher specializing in blockchain technology, cryptocurrency regulations, and macroeconomic trends shaping the crypto market.

Unless there is a major course correction, the U.S. should brace for a financial crisis leading up to congressional midterm elections next year, he warned.The world is losing faith in the dollar, and the U.S. could suffer a financial crisis next year, according to Desmond Lachman, a former deputy director of the International Monetary Funds Policy Development and Review Department.In aProject Syndicatecolumnon Monday, he noted that the U.S. fiscal situation was already shaky before President Donald Trump began his second term.But his tax cuts in the megabill that was just signed into law will add trillions to the deficit. Meanwhile, his tariffs and pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates have further weakened confidence in the dollar by stoking inflation concerns, Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, explained.Add to that Trumps apparent disregard for the rule of law, and markets see little reason to trust the US, he added.In his view, thats why the dollar sank 10 against other top global currencies in the first half of the year, marking the greenbacks worst such performance since 1953.The plunge came despite the tariffs and the wider premium between U.S. rates and those of other top economies, which would normally boost the dollar.Golds surge of more than 25 this year is another sign of collapsing market confidence in the U.S., as is Treasury yields remaining elevated despite market turbulence, Lachman said.That all adds up to a very clear vote of no confidence from financial markets in the Trump administrations economic policies.The problem for Trump is that, unlike politicians, markets cannot be pressured or primaried, he said, referring to the threat of ousting disobedient lawmakers via primary elections. If he refuses to heed investors warnings, as seems likely, the US should brace for a dollar and bond-market crisis in the run-up to next years midterm elections. The days of the world letting America live beyond its means are rapidly coming to an end.To be sure, many on Wall Street have been sounding alarms about tariffs, inflation, widening deficits, unsustainable debt, the dollar and demand for U.S. Treasuries.But so far, tariffs havefailed to trigger a spike in inflation, while the revenue collected from the duties is on pace to reach 300 billion this year.La historia continúaAnd despite warnings that bond vigilantes will express displeasure with fiscal policies by demanding higher yields on bonds, that has yet to materialize. In fact, recent Treasury auctions have shown there remains healthy demand for U.S. debt, for now.In addition, many analysts see the dollar retaining its status as the worlds primary reserve currency despite attempts to push alternatives.John Queen, fixed income portfolio manager at Capital Group, said in arecent notethat bond markets are adapting to higher debt levels, adding that the interest rate market is incredibly efficient at pricing in risks.While he is concerned about the size of the debt and its impact on borrowing costs, its unknown when those worries will become reality.Many people have predicted that catastrophe is right around the corner and, someday, one of them is going to be right, Queen wrote.

(Lower rates often make the dollar less attractive to investors, who look for better returns in other currencies.)We have since learned that a lot can change in six months. The US currency just completed its worst first-half return in 52 years, falling 10.8 through the end of June. In 1973, Richard Nixon was in office, and it was still five years before Christopher Reeve, never mind David Corenswet, would play Superman.Through its resilient run last year, the dollar had advantages. The US economy outpaced its developed nation peers. Other central banks, looking to stimulate growth, embarked on their own, more aggressive rate-cutting sprees, and the end of 2024 saw the biggest gap between the US 10-year bond yield and the equivalent of its key trading partners since 1994, JPMorgan noted.But nothing lasts forever, the banks analysts were quick to note, flagging that the dollar has alternated between periods of strength and weakness, making a downturn likely at some point. Thats proven the case in 2025; the question now is whether the greenback can, like the Man of Steel, defy gravity again or if, amid a wave of tariff uncertainty including levies on steel, theres still a significant downside to come.What a Buck is WorthWhy this all matters is pretty straightforward. The dollar is the most important currency on earth, accounting for 57.7 of global currency reserves in the first quarter, a slight decrease of about 10 basis points from the end of 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). So, when something happens to the dollar, something happens toalmost everything else.Yeah, the cost of that 1.20 morning espresso on the Roman holiday you have booked next month has crept up all year. That weakened international purchasing power can also bite at home: For example, a weak dollar means it costs more to import oil, which can increase gas prices at the pump and pinch your wallet even if you opt against a Roman holiday.But there can be an upside for some: Many US multinational companies (and with them, shareholders) can benefit from the weak dollar because their revenues denominated abroad are converted back to a softened greenback, good for the bottom line. A classic example is McDonalds, which hashistoricallydonewell with a weaker dollar (thoughnot this yearso far, as US consumers have turned sour on eating out due to economic worries).Oil giant Schlumberger madenearly80 of its revenue from international markets last year. Georgia-headquartered insurance company Aflac is one of the largest insurers in Japan and makes roughly 60 of its revenue from that market (the yen has gained more than 6 against the dollar this year).The weak dollar can also be good for shareholders of foreign companies, which benefit from a currency advantage when converting to buy items denominated in dollars. In a May report, Trivariate Research identified 16 periods since 2001 when the dollar weakened 5 or more, and found the median performance of US equities was a rise of 7.5 during those periods. That was the sixth-worst performance among 55 regions the firm evaluated, with the best performers being equities in Greece (up 17.6), Indonesia (up 17.5), and Peru (up 16.4).The Source of the Gravitational PullThe dollar sell-off, which has driven the currency to its lowest point since March 2022, has been tied to two very prominent things that youve read 15 Tolstoy novels worth about already this year: the radical realignment in US economic policies under a new administration, coupled with growing concerns about the US 36 trillion national debt and ballooning deficits.Both of these factors have raised doubts about the traditional safe-haven role of dollar-denominated assets. On-and-off tariff warring, in addition to panicking markets in April, has dragged US growth forecasts lower. In April, the IMFslashedits projection for US GDP growth in 2025 to 1.8 from 2.7, the steepest downgrade among developed countries.Meanwhile, deficit concerns led Moodys todowngradeUS government debt in May, which led the country to lose its last perfect credit rating. (Thats also related to why US bond yields have climbed, flashing investor worries about the sustainability of Americas mounting debt.)The US dollar is the most notable loser so far this year as it has lost 10 against other currencies, with investor concerns regarding Trumps policies having weighed on the greenback, wrote analysts at Unicredit.Theres also evidence to show institutions are building up defensive fortifications elsewhere: Central banks have ramped up their purchases of gold, a key dollar alternative, to 27 tons per month as of May,accordingto the World Gold Council.
