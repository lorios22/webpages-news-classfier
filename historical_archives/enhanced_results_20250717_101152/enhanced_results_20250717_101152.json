Thats more than they stole during all of 2024  and 17 more than then swindled during the same period in 2022, currently the worst year in history for crypto thefts with 3.8 billion worth of crypto stolen.Stolen fund activity stands out as the dominant concern in 2025. While other forms of illicit activity have shown mixed trends year-over-year, the surge in cryptocurrency thefts represents both an immediate threat to ecosystem participants and a long-term challenge for the industrys security infrastructure, the Chainalysis report said.The ballooning figure is largely driven by hacks linked to North Koreas state-sponsored hacking organization, the Lazarus Group, which was behind the record-setting 1.5 billion hack of crypto exchange Bybit earlier this year. Through their hack of Bybit alone, North Korea made more money than it did via hacking in the entirety of 2024(1.3 billion) previously their most lucrative year for crypto crime. According to Chainalysis report, the Lazarus Group has continued to use social engineering tactics  like fake workers or the offer of fictitious job interviews  to gain access to their targets.Wrench attacks on the riseAnother subset of crypto theft  so-called wrench attacks, in which attackers physically harm or intimidate crypto holders in order to access their personal wallet holdings  is also on the rise in 2025. According to Chainalysis, these types of physical attacks have led to a spike in personal wallet compromises, which account for 23.35 of the crypto thefts so far this year.In their report, Chainalyis attributed the uptick in personal wallet thefts to a confluence of factors including improved security practices at major services, which they said could be pushing attackers towards individuals perceived as easier targets, the increased value of crypto held in personal wallets over time, and the development of more sophisticated indidual-targeting techniques potentially driven by the rise in AI tools.It is clear that 2025 is well on track to have potentially twice as many physical attacks as the next highest year on record, the report said. It is also worth noting that, since many attacks go unreported, the true number of such incidents is likely far higher.Chainalysis report identified a clear correlation between the rise of wrench attacks and the rising price of Bitcoin, suggesting that a future increase in asset values(and the perception of its future upward movement)may trigger additional opportunistic physical attacks against known crypto holders.Overall, while these violent attacks remain comparatively rare, the physical dimension  including maiming, kidnapping, and homicide  elevates the human impact of these cases to an extraordinary degree, the report said.Chainalysis report urged crypto investors to improve their operational security(or OpSec), including keeping their crypto holdings private, to reduce the likelihood of being targeted by attackers. Substantial crypto holders the report suggested, might also consider traditional personal security measures, including hiring professional security personnel, may be warranted.On average, thieves targeting personal wallets are less sophisticated than their counterparts targeting exchanges and companies, Chainalysis said. Bad actors who target personal wallets  both wrench attackers and otherwise  leave larger balances of their stolen funds on chain rather than immediately laundering their ill-gotten gains using mixers or other methods. According to the report, personal wallet thieves currently hold around 8.5 billion in crypto on-chain, compared to just 1.2 billion in funds taken from services.North KoreaLazarus groupChainalysisCheyenne LigonOn the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime.

Token issuers can choose whether to adopt it, and those that dont will still function normally on the XRP Ledger.Indexers, wallets and apps that adopt the standard will just ignore or fail gracefully if a token lacks the expected fields, rather than crashing or misbehaving.Tokens that do adopt it will gain improved visibility and interoperability across XRPL-based tools and services, but theres no enforcement or penalty for non-compliance.While adoption remains voluntary, MPTs that follow this schema are expected to be more easily indexed and integrated, especially in future tooling across cross-chain bridges, on-chain analytics platforms and institutional-grade wallets.XRP was trading recently above 3, up more than 6 in the past 24 hours.RippleStandardsXRP LedgerShaurya MalwaShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.Shaurya holds over 1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.He provides over 1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.X iconLatest Crypto NewsPlasma Looks to Raise 50M From Token Sale, With Valuation of 500M, for EVM-Compatible Sidechain12 minutes agoXRP Nears Record High of 3.40 as Futures Open Interest Hits 10B15 minutes agoBitcoin Consolidates Below Record High, With Everyone From Shrimps to Whales Accumulating19 minutes agoTwo Arrested in UK on Suspicion of Running Illegal Crypto Exchange29 minutes agoBONK Jumps 19 as Altcoin Market Surge Accelerates1 hour agoDPRK-Linked Hacks Drive Potential Record Year for Crypto Theft",

This isnt just inflow-driven price action. Its a structural shift in how ETH is being held.Add to that a historically strong Moneyness Ratio  a metric capturing the share of ETH locked in productive use  and the market gets a flywheel few other tokens can replicate.ETH network demand still clocks in at around 2 million per day, but analysts suggest it could triple as more applications and treasuries integrate the token. Higher from here. Bid on, Lilly added.ETH is now up 22 month-to-date, and if the demand curve continues to steepen, we may still be far from reaching the peak of this move.Read more:Ether Traders Eye Record Highs as ETH Jumps 8; Bitcoin, BNB, SOL See Profit-TakingETHETFmarket analysisShaurya MalwaShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.Shaurya holds over 1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.He provides over 1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.X iconLatest Crypto NewsPlasma Looks to Raise 50M From Token Sale, With Valuation of 500M, for EVM-Compatible Sidechain12 minutes agoXRP Nears Record High of 3.40 as Futures Open Interest Hits 10B15 minutes agoBitcoin Consolidates Below Record High, With Everyone From Shrimps to Whales Accumulating19 minutes agoTwo Arrested in UK on Suspicion of Running Illegal Crypto Exchange29 minutes agoBONK Jumps 19 as Altcoin Market Surge Accelerates1 hour agoDPRK-Linked Hacks Drive Potential Record Year for Crypto Thefts, Chainalysis Says1 hour agoTop StoriesBitcoin Consolidates Below Record High, With Everyone From Shrimps to Whales Accumulating19 minutes agoEther Traders Eye Record Highs as ETH Jumps 8; Bitcoin, BNB, SOL See Profit-Taking7 hours agoEarly Bitcoin Investor Roger Ver Sues Spain to Prevent Extradition to the U.S.1 hour agoCrypto Market Maker B2C2 Said to Be Raising up to 200M: Source8 hours agoAltcoins Steal the Show as Bitcoin Builds Steam: Crypto Daybook Americas1 hour agoBiotech Company Windtree to Raise Up to 200M for BNB Treasury4 hours ago",

BlackRock's ETHA led with nearly $500 million in new inflows, followed by Fidelity's FETH and Grayscale's ETH.\n\nAnalysts note a structural shift in ETH demand due to Digital Asset Treasuries, potentially tripling network demand.\n\nEther (ETH) exchange traded funds (ETFs) just had their best day ever. The U.S.-listed funds attracted a record $726.74 million in daily net inflows on Wednesday, while ETH prices surged 8.1% to cross $3,560—the token's best single-day performance since March. That resulted in cumulative ETF inflows of $6.48 billion with total net assets now exceeding $16.41 billion, or 4% of ETH's circulating market capitalization.\n\nBlackRock's ETHA led the charge with nearly $500 million in new inflows and over $1.78 billion in trading volume, followed by Fidelity's FETH and Grayscale's newly launched ETH, which added a combined $167 million.\n\nBut beyond the headline numbers, something deeper may be unfolding. JLabs Digital's Ben Lilly said in a Wednesday insight that a new wave of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) funds and corporates accumulating ETH for yield, collateral, or payments is changing the token's demand profile. \"We're seeing hundreds of millions in ETH demand that simply didn't exist before,\" Lilly wrote, pointing to a dynamic similar to PayPal's early crypto push. This isn't just inflow-driven price action. It's a structural shift in how ETH is being held.\n\nAdd to that a historically strong Moneyness Ratio—a metric capturing the share of ETH locked in productive use—and the market gets a flywheel few other tokens can replicate. ETH network demand still clocks in at around 2 million per day, but analysts suggest it could triple as more applications and treasuries integrate the token. \"Higher from here. Bid on,\" Lilly added.\n\nETH is now up 22% month-to-date, and if the demand curve continues to steepen, we may still be far from reaching the peak of this move.",

U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs saw their tenth consecutive day of net inflows, led by BlackRock's IBIT with 763 million.\n\nAnalysts are divided on bitcoin's momentum, with some predicting a rise to 150,000 by Q3 amid ETF inflows and macroeconomic factors.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) steadied near 118,300, up 6.6% for the week, as June's U.S. CPI print cooled investor nerves even as ETF-driven inflows continued, with eyes on ether (ETH) as watchers await a breakout to record highs. The largest cryptocurrency hovered near 118,400, logging a modest 0.4% daily gain and up 6.5% over the week, while ether held above 3,340, climbing 6.7% in the past 24 hours and 20.5% over seven days. XRP (XRP) continued its vertical run, rising 6.4% on the day to 3.09, with a 27% weekly gain.\n\nSolana's SOL (SOL) ticked up 5% to 170, and dogecoin (DOGE) added 6%, trading just above 20 cents. BNB Coin (BNB) rose nearly 3% to 708, and Tron’s TRX (TRX) rose 3.7% to 31 cents.\n\nThe broader market remains risk-on, with top assets extending gains for the second straight day on continued ETF optimism and easing macro conditions. The macroeconomic narrative played out across traditional markets too. Asian equities dipped as investors recalibrated rate-cut timing, gold edged higher, and the dollar softened, further supporting crypto gains. U.S. equities showed modest weakness, weighed down by tariff concerns, as investors retrenched ahead of the summer.\n\nImportantly, the dollar index (DXY) is down roughly 10% year-to-date, providing substantial support to dollar-denominated crypto assets and broad risk plays alike. Amidst this tug-of-war between profit-taking and new demand, analysts are divided. QCP traders said in a Wednesday note that bitcoin's momentum briefly stalled after cresting past 120,000, with a support zone developing between 114,000 and 118,000, where downside bids began re-emerging.

The structure score (5.0) highlights poor organization and formatting, making it difficult to read. The fact-checking score (7.5) suggests that while the claims are plausible, they remain unverified, affecting credibility. Overall, the article is informative but requires significant improvements in clarity, organization, and depth to enhance its overall quality."

The 3.00 level was breached, marking a psychological and technical milestone, supported by over 170 million in trading volume. Institutional interest is evident as support held at 2.98-3.00, with potential for further gains if momentum continues.\n\nXRP jumped 4.85 from 2.91 to 3.05 between July 16 05:00 and July 17 04:00, forming a 0.19 range (6.18 volatility) and peaking at 3.09 on strong volume. Afternoon session (17:00-20:00) saw volume exceed 170 million as XRP breached the 3.00 barrier - a psychological and technical milestone. Support formed within the 2.98-3.00 zone and held into the close, signaling continued institutional interest. Final hour (03:39-04:38) price advanced from 2.99 to 3.05 (1.97), with volume bursts over 3.8 million confirming the breakout.\n\n**News Background**\nXRP careened out of a prolonged consolidation range as institutional flows surged ahead of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF launch set for July 18. Volume-sustained momentum through 3.00 marks a significant shift from recent sideways price action with whales and treasury desks re-entering near breakout zones. While RSI enters overbought territory, technical strategists suggest a sustained close above 3.00 could unlock price discovery toward fresh highs.\n\n**Price Action Summary**\n- **Range:** 2.91 - 3.09 (0.19 swing, 6.18 volatility)\n- **Breakout Sessions:** 170M volume cleared 3.00 resistance during afternoon trading\n- **Support Zone:** 2.98-3.00 held firm through pullbacks\n- **Final Hour:** XRP rallied from 2.99 - 3.05 (1.97) with volume triggers\n- **Resistance:** 3.09 noted as short-term profit-taking zone\n\n**Technical Analysis**\nInstitutional-backed breakout confirmed by heavy volume and clean structure. Support firm near 2.98-2.99, marking a solid base for continuation. RSI enters overbought, flagging potential for consolidation. Key breakout validation required above 3.05-3.09 with sustained volume. Upside targets: 3.40-3.60 initially; potentially 4.80-5.00 on ETF-led momentum.\n\n**What Traders Are Watching**\n- Will 3.00 flip into support on Monday's session?\n- Breaks above 3.09 with volume could spark moves toward 3.40\n- Watch RSI - if consolidation is needed, dip to 2.95-2.98 offers entry\n- ETF launch could be a catalyst, but sustainability depends on follow-through flow.\n\n**Takeaway**\nXRP's breakout is anchored in real volume, not just narrative. Clearing 3.00 on 170M volume marks a structural shift ahead of the ETF launch. If momentum holds, next targets lie in the 3.40-3.60 range - possibly higher with continued institutional participation.",

Built atop protocols such as Farcaster(for social)and XMTP(for chat), Base App users will be able to post content, chat with friends, send USDC with tap-to-pay, and earn rewards directly through their activity. In addition, the Base App will introduce a mini app ecosystem, with embedded applications that users can discover and interact with directly in their feed.Those that have the Coinbase Wallet application in their phones will automatically have it switched to the Base app in the next few hours.Bases rebrand also includes performance upgrades to the layer-2 network. Base Chain, previously just Base, will have block times drop from 2 seconds to 200 milliseconds  which should improve the user experience.As the Base ecosystem grows, Coinbase is also introducing Base Account and Base Pay to round out the product suite.Base Account acts as a cross-chain identity and smart wallet that automatically provisions upon signup. Users can now Sign in with Base across compatible dapps, taking their identity with them.Base Pay introduces a streamlined USDC checkout flow, with integrations already live on Shopify. Coinbase says the payment system allows instant, fee-free transfers in USDC and will soon include 1 cashback incentives for U.S. customers.With this new direction, Coinbase is positioning Base as more than an Ethereum scaling solution.This isnt something were building alone. Its being shaped by thousands of developers, creators, and communities building on Base every day, the team wrote in a press release.Read more:With 25M Boost from Coinbase, Crypto Sectors Fairshake PAC Has 141M for ElectionsDisclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards.For more information, seeCoinDesks full AI Policy.Coinbasecoinbase-walletBaselayer 2Margaux NijkerkMargaux is CoinDesks Tech  Protocols reporter, where she focuses mostly on the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems.

As the Base ecosystem grows, Coinbase is also introducing Base Account and Base Pay to round out the product suite.\n\nBase Account acts as a cross-chain identity and smart wallet that automatically provisions upon signup. Users can now sign in with Base across compatible dapps, taking their identity with them. Base Pay introduces a streamlined USDC checkout flow, with integrations already live on Shopify. Coinbase says the payment system allows instant, fee-free transfers in USDC and will soon include 1% cashback incentives for U.S. customers.\n\nWith this new direction, Coinbase is positioning Base as more than an Ethereum scaling solution. \"This isn't something we're building alone. It's being shaped by thousands of developers, creators, and communities building on Base every day,\" the team wrote in a press release.",

In recent months, the firm expanded its crypto derivatives lineup to include solanaSOL176.73and XRPXRP3.2489, in addition to its existing bitcoinBTC117,935.70and ethereumETH3,423.53offerings.That bet appears to be paying off. Since launching in February, SOL futures volumes have moved close to 5 billion, with daily trading averaging between 75 million and 100 million. XRP futures, which debuted in May, saw a record 235 million in volume last Friday and have crossed nearly 2 billion in volume to date.The products trade on a regular weekly schedule  from Sunday 6 p.m. ET to Friday 5 p.m. ET  with a one-hour daily maintenance window. That setup contrasts with the always-on nature of spot crypto markets, which some U.S. stock exchanges are beginning to replicate to attract crypto-savvy traders.Major U.S. stock exchanges like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange(NYSE)are already several steps into adapting their infrastructure for 247 trading, aiming to better serve market participants active in crypto and other fast-moving asset classes. While CME hasnt made any formal commitments, it is watching closely. Its something that were exploring, but no plans as of yet, Vicioso said. As we continue to see the maturity in the space and we continue to see interest build in our products, I think its important for us to consider covering that gap that now exists between Friday evening and Sunday evening.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards.For more information, seeCoinDesks full AI Policy.CME GroupHelene BraunHelene is a New York-based markets reporter at CoinDesk, covering the latest news from Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds and updates on crypto markets.

          "cleaned_content": "CME Exploring 24/7 Crypto Trading Expansion, Says Memecoin Products Are Off the Table\n\nThough recently expanding into Solana and XRP futures, the derivatives exchange giant is drawing the line at memecoins, citing lack of real-world use.\n\nCME Group has no plans to launch derivatives tied to memecoins, citing the absence of practical use cases. The exchange is seeing growing institutional interest in its Solana and XRP futures, which have generated billions in volume. CME is considering moving to 24/7 trading to align with crypto markets but has not yet made a formal decision.\n\nCME Group (CME), the world's largest derivatives exchange, is steering clear of memecoins even as issuers line up to bring more speculative tokens into mainstream finance.\n\nWhile asset managers like VanEck and 21Shares are pushing to launch spot exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to coins like dogecoin and Trump Coin, CME is taking a different route. \"We're launching these products based on underlying coins and tokens that have a use case, so I don't anticipate that we will be doing anything in the memecoin space, as the use case for such products is really not there,\" said Gio Vicioso, CME's global head of cryptocurrency products.\n\nInstead, CME is focused on tokens it sees as foundational to blockchain infrastructure. In recent months, the firm expanded its crypto derivatives lineup to include Solana and XRP, in addition to its existing bitcoin and ethereum offerings. That bet appears to be paying off. Since launching in February, SOL futures volumes have moved close to 5 billion, with daily trading averaging between 75 million and 100 million. XRP futures, which debuted in May, saw a record 235 million in volume last Friday and have crossed nearly 2 billion in volume to date.\n\nThe products trade on a regular weekly schedule from Sunday 6 p.m. ET to Friday 5 p.m. ET with a one-hour daily maintenance window. That setup contrasts with the always-on nature of spot crypto markets, which some U.S. stock exchanges are beginning to replicate to attract crypto-savvy traders. Major U.S. stock exchanges like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are already several steps into adapting their infrastructure for 24/7 trading, aiming to better serve market participants active in crypto and other fast-moving asset classes. While CME hasn't made any formal commitments, it is watching closely. \"It's something that we're exploring, but no plans as of yet,\" Vicioso said. \"As we continue to see the maturity in the space and we continue to see interest build in our products, I think it's important for us to consider covering that gap that now exists between Friday evening and Sunday evening.\"\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

Another witness, a lawyer for crypto exchange BitMart, which was hacked for nearly 200 million in 2021, said that Storm told his team that there was nothing he or his fellow developers could do to retrieve the funds given the decentralized nature of the protocol.A third witness, Andy Ho  CTO and co-founder at Sky Mavis, the blockchain gaming company behind Axie Infinity and the Ronin Network  detailed how hackers stole over 625 million in an exploit of Ronin Bridge in 2022, in effect fully looting the protocols coffers. Though Ho himself didnt mention it during his testimony, the group behind the exploit waslater revealed to be the Lazarus Group, North Koreas state-sponsored hacking organization, which used Tornado Cash to launder a portion of the stolen funds.During their examination of the three witnesses, prosecutors attempted to paint a portrait of Storm as someone who refused to lift a finger to help hack victims, or to make changes to the Tornado Cash protocol to dissuade future use of the protocol by criminals.Storms lawyers, when they had the chance to cross-examine the victim witnesses, cast their clients lack of action in another light: he was, they insinuated, unable to help retrieve funds, because Tornado Cash was decentralized. Storm told BitMarts lawyer  New York-based Joseph Evans, a partner at law firm McDermott, Will and Emery  so himself in an email on Dec. 15, 2021, according to an exhibit introduced by the government.Evans also admitted on cross-examination that Tornado Cash wasnt the only place BitMarts hacked funds went after the exploit: his firm also reached out to 1inch, a decentralized exchange aggregator, which told them to come back with a warrant, as well as Cloudflare  a major website infrastructure provider  and Binance. Evans said he received no response from the latter two companies.Brian Klein, a partner at Waymaker LLP and a lawyer for Roman Storm, asked Evans if it was true that the only person who had ever directly responded to Evans inquiries in the wake of BitMarts hack was Roman Storm.Thats correct, Evans said.Storms lawyers asked Ho, the CTO of Sky Mavis, a similar line of questions when he was on the stand, though Ho  who said he had been subpoenaed by the government and asked to travel to New York from his hometown of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to testify  was less forthcoming.Keri Axel, another Waymaker partner and member of Storms defense team, asked Ho if he remembered the findings presented to Sky Mavis by Crowdstrike after the exploit, including that the stolen funds had filtered through a number of protocols and exchanges besides Tornado Cash, including FTX, Huobi, andCrypto.com.I dont recall, Ho said to each.Axel asked how much, if any, of the stolen money was able to ultimately be recovered. Ho said that 6 million was returned by Norwegian police.Did you understand that that 6 million had gone through Tornado Cash? Axel asked Ho.I dont have that knowledge, Ho said.Read more:Legitimate Privacy Tool or Dirty Money Laundromat?

          "cleaned_content": "Hack and scam victims who reached out to Tornado Cash requesting assistance retrieving their stolen funds received little in the way of help from the privacy tools developers, three government witnesses told the jury during day two of Roman Storm's criminal money laundering trial.\n\n### What to know:\nVictims of hacks and scams received minimal assistance from Tornado Cash developers in recovering stolen funds, according to government witness testimony in Roman Storm's trial. Prosecutors argued that Storm did not act to prevent criminal use of Tornado Cash, while his defense claimed the decentralized nature of the protocol limited his ability to help. Testimonies revealed that stolen funds from major hacks, including BitMart and Ronin Bridge, were laundered through various platforms, not just Tornado Cash.\n\nOne victim, a Taiwan-born Georgia woman who said she lost nearly 250,000 to a wrong-number pig butchering scam with a portion of the proceeds laundered through Tornado Cash, said her request for help went unanswered. Another witness, a lawyer for crypto exchange BitMart, which was hacked for nearly 200 million in 2021, said that Storm told his team that there was nothing he or his fellow developers could do to retrieve the funds given the decentralized nature of the protocol.\n\nA third witness, Andy Ho, CTO and co-founder at Sky Mavis, the blockchain gaming company behind Axie Infinity and the Ronin Network, detailed how hackers stole over 625 million in an exploit of Ronin Bridge in 2022, in effect fully looting the protocol's coffers. Though Ho himself didn't mention it during his testimony, the group behind the exploit was later revealed to be the Lazarus Group, North Korea's state-sponsored hacking organization, which used Tornado Cash to launder a portion of the stolen funds.\n\nDuring their examination of the three witnesses, prosecutors attempted to paint a portrait of Storm as someone who refused to lift a finger to help hack victims, or to make changes to the Tornado Cash protocol to dissuade future use of the protocol by criminals. Storm's lawyers, when they had the chance to cross-examine the victim witnesses, cast their client's lack of action in another light: he was, they insinuated, unable to help retrieve funds, because Tornado Cash was decentralized. Storm told BitMart's lawyer, New York-based Joseph Evans, a partner at law firm McDermott, Will and Emery, so himself in an email on Dec. 15, 2021, according to an exhibit introduced by the government.\n\nEvans also admitted on cross-examination that Tornado Cash wasn't the only place BitMart's hacked funds went after the exploit: his firm also reached out to 1inch, a decentralized exchange aggregator, which told them to come back with a warrant, as well as Cloudflare, a major website infrastructure provider, and Binance. Evans said he received no response from the latter two companies.\n\nBrian Klein, a partner at Waymaker LLP and a lawyer for Roman Storm, asked Evans if it was true that the only person who had ever directly responded to Evans' inquiries in the wake of BitMart's hack was Roman Storm. \"That's correct,\" Evans said.\n\nStorm's lawyers asked Ho, the CTO of Sky Mavis, a similar line of questions when he was on the stand, though Ho, who said he had been subpoenaed by the government and asked to travel to New York from his hometown of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to testify, was less forthcoming. Keri Axel, another Waymaker partner and member of Storm's defense team, asked Ho if he remembered the findings presented to Sky Mavis by Crowdstrike after the exploit, including that the stolen funds had filtered through a number of protocols and exchanges besides Tornado Cash, including FTX, Huobi, and Crypto.com. \"I don't recall,\" Ho said to each.\n\nAxel asked how much, if any, of the stolen money was able to ultimately be recovered. Ho said that 6 million was returned by Norwegian police. \"Did you understand that that 6 million had gone through Tornado Cash?\" Axel asked Ho. \"I don't have that knowledge,\" Ho said.",

The director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency(FHFA), Bill Pulte, has accused the chairman of political bias and called for a congressional investigation into his leadership.Republican members of Congress(such Senators Rick Scott and Tommy Tuberville, and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan)have, too, criticized Powells actions over the past few months.Then theres Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor  and potential Powell replacement  who says that its time for regime change at the Fed.(Im only naming a few people, but the list is long.)Now, the Federal Reserve is technically independent, so Powell is protected from arbitrary dismissal and can only be removed for cause, meaning there needs to be a serious, legally justified reason to fire him.Powells critics are now using the Federal Reserves 2.5 billion headquarters renovation asa new angle of attack, alleging potential misconduct or that Powell misled Congress in his testimony regarding the renovation.(The project was set in motion years before Trump appointed Powell in 2018.)The pressure has increased even more in the last couple of days. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentsaidon Tuesday that a formal process to replace Powell was underway. A few hours later, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Lunatweetedthat Powells firing was imminent, sending Polymarket odds of the event to 27.The rumors did not abate on Wednesday. Bloomberg and CBSreportedtoday that Trump was looking to pull the trigger soon, while The New York Timesclaimedthat the president had already drafted a letter to the effect.Trump, however, immediately said hewasnt planningon firing the Fed chairman, and even downplayed accusations of fraud about the 2.5 billion headquarters renovation.Where does that leave us? Lets keep our eyes on the prize: CME FedWatchindicatestheres only a 2.6 chance of rates coming down at the next Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC)meeting, scheduled for July 30.

Here's why: Powell, who hurriedly cut federal interest rates by 75 basis points ahead of the 2024 election, has been reluctant to ease monetary conditions further, citing potentially inflationary effects of the White House's new tariff policies.\n\nTrump has been floating the idea of firing him for a while now. The regulator, for his part, has maintained since November that Trump lacks the legal authority to do so. Powell's term is slated to end in May 2026 in any case.\n\nJerome Powell has been very bad for our country, Trump said over the weekend. We should have the lowest interest rate on Earth, and we don't. He just refuses to do it.\n\nThe coalition against Powell appears to be growing by the day. The director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Bill Pulte, has accused the chairman of political bias and called for a congressional investigation into his leadership. Republican members of Congress (such Senators Rick Scott and Tommy Tuberville, and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan) have, too, criticized Powell's actions over the past few months.

(Jesse HamiltonCoinDesk)What to know:The Houses efforts to pass crypto week bills stalled out again Wednesday, despite assurances by U.S. President Donald Trump that the legislation was back on track Tuesday evening.This is the Houses second effort to move past a procedural hurdle to advance crypto bills, after a Tuesday vote failed.The U.S. House of Representatives stalled out on a procedural vote to advance to a final poll on key crypto legislation Wednesday, after passing an earlier procedural motion.The House voted earlier Wednesday to reconsider debate on a motion to set how the chamber would move forward on the bills after that rules motion saw a hiccup Tuesday when the House Freedom Caucus voted against advancing to debate and a final vote. While the rules motion is procedural, a majority of lawmakers need to vote in favor before the House can vote on the actual bills.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Wednesdays vote should have meant that the Clarity Act, GENIUS Act and Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act will all receive final votes, potentially starting as soon as later in the day. The first procedural measure passed 217-215, but the second one remained open as of press time, more than 100 minutes after it began. A group of Republicans voted no at the 2.5 hour mark, further imperiling the passage of the legislation. As of 3:55 p.m. ET, there were 210 yes votes to 218 nos, meaning Republicans would need to flip at least four of the nays to keep the legislation moving.The issue lies in the stablecoin bill.

The team behind the network shared that the initial distribution will occur over the next 30 days, and a total of 1 billion ES tokens have been minted, with distribution structured to go to community incentives and long-term protocol sustainability. Of the supply, 15 is allocated to an airdrop and liquidity provisions for core community members and developers who have supported the network from the start. 35 will support ecosystem growth and research and development, aimed to help scale the network. Contributors will receive 19 of the supply, including team members, with a four year vesting period and three year lockup schedule. The remaining 31 is for early supporters and investors, who are subject to a three year lockup schedule to commit to Eclipses roadmap long-term.

With Boundless incentivized testnet, developers can build and test applications in an environment as if the protocol is in fully live format. The network has already landed early support from industry heavyweights like the Ethereum Foundation, Wormhole and EigenLayer. A decentralized marketplace for zero-knowledge compute connects those who need zero-knowledge proofs  such as developers building rollups, bridges, or privacy-preserving applications  with a distributed network of independent ZK provers or miners who generate and verify those proofs. Instead of relying on centralized parties, this model allows anyone with the right hardware to contribute computing power and be rewarded for doing that cryptographic work.

Thats according to a new draft proposal co-authored by Jameson Lopp and other crypto security researchers, which introduces a phased soft fork that turns quantum migration into a ticking clock. Fail to upgrade, and your coins become unspendable. That includes the roughly 1.1 million BTC tied to earlypay-to-pubkey addresses, like those of Satoshis and other early miners. This proposal is radically different from any in Bitcoins history just as the threat posed by quantum computing is radically different from any other threat in Bitcoins history, the authors explained as a motivation for the proposal.

The writing style is somewhat engaging but suffers from disorganization and a lack of logical flow, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, the claims made are largely unverified, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of the information provided.

Ethereum was holding steady above 700. Under the glow of fluorescent lights and an air of optimism, two young men posed for a photo that would become one of cryptos most enduring snapshots.Frédéric Fortier wore an Ethereum sweater. Mathieu Baril wore a Bitcoin one. Theirimagelanded in aNew York Timesfeature published weeks later under the headline:Everyone Is Getting Hilariously Rich and Youre Not.Weeks later, the market began to crack and, at that point, experienced one of its steepest declines in its history.The 2018 crypto meltdown, dubbed the Great Crypto Crash, saw Bitcoin fall over 80 from its all-time high, triggering a broader wipeout across nearly all digital assets.Thedownturnbegan in January of the year, accelerated by regulatory fears, a 530 million hack at Coincheck, and ad bans from Facebook, Google, and Twitter.By December, Bitcoin had dropped to around 3,100, an 84 drawdown from its peak that surpassed the scale of the dot-com collapse.For years, not many really knew what happened to the sweater-clad duo.Threads on X resurfaced the image sporadically. Somejokedthat the Ethereum guy slow rugged. Others figured theyd cashed out and disappeared.But they might be wrong.Fortier is now listed as a co-founder and lead contributor at DerivaDEX, a decentralized derivatives exchange, according toCrunchbase,LinkedIn, andXprofiles reviewed byDecrypt.DerivaDEX is built through a research and development group called DEX Labs.Those profiles indicate that he built trading infrastructure at Enigma, where he helped launch Catalyst, one of the earliest algorithmic crypto platforms. He appears to have remained active in the Ethereum ecosystem, trading and building through multiple boom-and-bust cycles.Notably, Fortiers first name was spelled as Fredric in the originalNew York Timespiece, not Frédéric as his LinkedIn profile suggests.Baril, on the other hand, took a different path.Hes now CEO of Octav, a Web3 analytics startup specializing in on-chain transaction labeling for DAOs, crypto treasuries, and institutional clients. He also teaches treasury strategy at the Crypto Accounting Academy.Oh shit, my photo again! Is it the top ? Bariltweetedon Wednesday. Should I put it on again? he lateradded.Neither has made a huge deal of their early crypto fame. But the legacy of that photo, just two guys in Hodlmoon holiday sweaters, at the height of 2017 euphoria, still floats about.While the image froze them in time, both kept moving, their giddy, grinning faces showing up from time to time in memes, explainer decks, and nostalgic Twitter posts.Some others havereworkedthe iconic photo to present the current hype cycle, pointing to Pump.fun and Hyperliquid as the new Bitcoin and Ethereum.Still, their paths somehow reflect an observable split in the crypto space itself: spectacle versus substance.

          "cleaned_content": "In brief\nMathieu Baril and Frédéric Fortier were featured in a viral NYT photo during crypto's first mainstream boom. Fortier has co-founded a decentralized derivatives exchange, while Baril now leads on-chain analytics startup Octav. Both appear to have quietly built serious crypto careers, while the photo became a time capsule of the 2017 bull run.\n\nDecrypt's Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.\n\nDiscover SCENE\nThe San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup holiday party in December 2017 was packed with crypto hopefuls. Bitcoin had just hit nearly 20,000. Ethereum was holding steady above 700. Under the glow of fluorescent lights and an air of optimism, two young men posed for a photo that would become one of crypto's most enduring snapshots. Frédéric Fortier wore an Ethereum sweater. Mathieu Baril wore a Bitcoin one. Their image landed in a New York Times feature published weeks later under the headline: \"Everyone Is Getting Hilariously Rich and You're Not.\"\n\nWeeks later, the market began to crack and, at that point, experienced one of its steepest declines in its history. The 2018 crypto meltdown, dubbed the Great Crypto Crash, saw Bitcoin fall over 80% from its all-time high, triggering a broader wipeout across nearly all digital assets. The downturn began in January of the year, accelerated by regulatory fears, a $530 million hack at Coincheck, and ad bans from Facebook, Google, and Twitter. By December, Bitcoin had dropped to around 3,100, an 84% drawdown from its peak that surpassed the scale of the dot-com collapse.\n\nFor years, not many really knew what happened to the sweater-clad duo. Threads on X resurfaced the image sporadically. Some joked that the Ethereum guy slow rugged. Others figured they'd cashed out and disappeared. But they might be wrong.\n\nFortier is now listed as a co-founder and lead contributor at DerivaDEX, a decentralized derivatives exchange, according to Crunchbase, LinkedIn, and X profiles reviewed by Decrypt. DerivaDEX is built through a research and development group called DEX Labs. Those profiles indicate that he built trading infrastructure at Enigma, where he helped launch Catalyst, one of the earliest algorithmic crypto platforms. He appears to have remained active in the Ethereum ecosystem, trading and building through multiple boom-and-bust cycles. Notably, Fortier's first name was spelled as Fredric in the original New York Times piece, not Frédéric as his LinkedIn profile suggests.\n\nBaril, on the other hand, took a different path. He's now CEO of Octav, a Web3 analytics startup specializing in on-chain transaction labeling for DAOs, crypto treasuries, and institutional clients. He also teaches treasury strategy at the Crypto Accounting Academy. \"Oh shit, my photo again! Is it the top?\" Baril tweeted on Wednesday. \"Should I put it on again?\" he later added.\n\nNeither has made a huge deal of their early crypto fame. But the legacy of that photo, just two guys in Hodlmoon holiday sweaters, at the height of 2017 euphoria, still floats about. While the image froze them in time, both kept moving, their giddy, grinning faces showing up from time to time in memes, explainer decks, and nostalgic Twitter posts. Some others have reworked the iconic photo to present the current hype cycle, pointing to Pump.fun and Hyperliquid as the new Bitcoin and Ethereum. Still, their paths somehow reflect an observable split in the crypto space itself: spectacle versus substance. While others vanished, they built.",

A 2024 survey of South Korean crypto investorsfound that 26.8ranked deposit and withdrawal speed as the most important factor when choosing an exchange, ahead of both liquidity and reputation.Meanwhile, Binances 2024 Global User Survey, based on responses from over 27,000 participants,reported that 17.2cited transaction speed and ease as a key reason for entering crypto in the first place. Transaction speed is no longer a bonus, its a baseline. Most exchanges still lag far behind.Two years ago, 10-minute swaps were the norm. Today, were consistently delivering under two, said Pauline Shangett, Chief Strategy Officer at ChangeNOW. Thats not just fast for Web3, its on par with the fastest crypto transfer solutions in fintech.The platforms performance was independently validated inthe July 2025 Swapzone Industry Report, which benchmarks real-time swap speeds across leading instant-exchange platforms. According to the report, the current industry median is 9-10 minutes, placing ChangeNOW among the top performers in the non-custodial segment.Speed has become mission-critical, Shangett added. As real-world use cases scale and institutions demand fintech-grade UX from decentralized platforms, we anticipate sub-minute swaps becoming the industry standard by 2026. Latency will no longer be tolerated, especially in cross-chain and payment-focused applications. Were building infrastructure that meets that bar today, not years from now.About ChangeNOWChangeNOW.io is a crypto management platform that offers regular people and businesses to access their Web3 finances in a simple and secure way.

Today, we're consistently delivering under two,\" said Pauline Shangett, Chief Strategy Officer at ChangeNOW. \"That's not just fast for Web3, it's on par with the fastest crypto transfer solutions in fintech.\"\n\nThe platform's performance was independently validated in the July 2025 Swapzone Industry Report, which benchmarks real-time swap speeds across leading instant-exchange platforms. According to the report, the current industry median is 9-10 minutes, placing ChangeNOW among the top performers in the non-custodial segment.\n\n\"Speed has become mission-critical,\" Shangett added. \"As real-world use cases scale and institutions demand fintech-grade UX from decentralized platforms, we anticipate sub-minute swaps becoming the industry standard by 2026. Latency will no longer be tolerated, especially in cross-chain and payment-focused applications. We're building infrastructure that meets that bar today, not years from now.\"\n\nAbout ChangeNOW\nChangeNOW.io is a crypto management platform that offers regular people and businesses to access their Web3 finances in a simple and secure way. Since 2017, ChangeNOW has evolved from a fast, secure and limitless instant crypto exchange to a platform where over 5 million users worldwide safely store, exchange, trade and stake their crypto assets.",

          "cleaned_content": "In Brief\nMeme coins like FLOKI and BONK soar as Ethereum's narrative drives market momentum, while PENGU and PUMP falter.\n\nEthereum's growing strength leads to a 6% rise in meme coin market cap, with the broader altcoin market nearing 1.42 trillion. Institutional interest in Ethereum and related tokens fuels meme coin gains, with FLOKI and SHIB benefiting the most.\n\nThe winds are shifting in the meme coin market, with Ethereum (ETH) reclaiming dominance across institutional and retail markets. Traders are rotating capital out of weaker narratives like PENGU (Pudgy Penguins) and PUMP (Pump.fun), and into tokens with stronger momentum and perceived fundamentals.\n\n### Ethereum's Narrative Awakens Meme Coin Season\nSome meme coins, including Floki Inu (FLOKI), Bonk Inu (BONK), and Fartcoin (FART) are posting double-digit gains. Meanwhile, others, including PENGU and PUMP, are recording losses.\n\nMore specifically, FLOKI leads today's gainers with a 40% pump, followed by BONK (16%), Fartcoin (18%), and PEPE (5%). Meanwhile, DOGE and SHIB added 7% and 4.5% respectively. In contrast, PENGU and PUMP have fallen out of favor, plunging 8% and 21% as of the latest CoinGecko data.\n\n![Meme Coins Awaken Amid Ethereum Narrative. Source: Coingecko](https://example.com/image1)\n\nThe broader meme coin market cap is up 6%, nearing the 80 billion mark. It aligns with a recent BeInCrypto report, which indicated the early signs of a meme coin season in July. Elsewhere, on CoinMarketCap's altcoin season index, the altcoin trend is accelerating, suggesting capital is actively rotating away from Bitcoin.\n\n![Altcoin Season Index. Source: CoinMarketCap](https://example.com/image2)\n\nThis capital rotation, coupled with a surge in meme coins, accentuates the onset of the colloquial altcoin season. Data on TradingView shows the altcoin market cap at 1.42 trillion, the highest since early February.\n\n### TOTAL3 just reclaimed the 1 Trillion mark\n\nThe assumption holds given meme coins' role reflecting broader market sentiment, particularly among altcoins, with investors looking at this class of tokens as a speculative liquidity point. When the altcoin market is turning bullish, meme coins often reflect the sentiment first.\n\nMeme coins are a global shelling point for speculative liquidity. Anyone from any country can access them much more easily than any stock in the world, wrote Andrew Kang in a recent post.\n\nAt the core of this reshuffle is Ethereum's renewed narrative strength, which, like XRP, is benefiting from the GENIUS Act. The perception of the bill's potential to restrict centralized yield-bearing stablecoins is stirring excitement. This could drive more capital into Ethereum-native DeFi protocols, ultimately boosting ETH's long-term value proposition.\n\nAccording to analyst Crypto Auris, speculators are already front-running the narrative. Ethereum is ripping and the GENIUS Act might be a big reason why. Here's what's driving ETH (and why I think it's just getting started): Speculators seem to be front-running the narrative already (let's be honest, many were likely positioning weeks ago), betting that...\n\n![Ethereum-based tokens are thriving under this momentum, including SHIB, PEPE, and the top gainer, FLOKI.](https://example.com/image3)\n\nInstitutional players are riding on the same wave and sentiment, with Sharplink Gaming adding ETH to its treasury, only days after accelerating its buying spree. We didn't adopt ETH to follow trends, we adopted it to lead, SBET (SharpLink Gaming).\n\nWith the latest purchase, it has surpassed the Ethereum Foundation. As institutional attention rises fast, meme coins running on Ethereum are following suit.",

Based on a survey of 4,599 crypto wallet users conducted in early 2025, the report highlights thatgaming (36),daily purchases (35), andtravel bookings (35)are the top categories where users express the strongest interest in paying with crypto. The results point to a demand for practical, day-to-day applications of digital assets in both online and offline environments.The report captures preferences across generational cohorts. Gen Z (aged 1829) shows strong interest in social and entertainment-driven use cases, including gaming and gifting. Millennials (3044) express more diversified use across travel, subscriptions, and digital goods. Gen X (45) favors high-value or essential categories such as travel (40), digital products, and real estate.

With substantial ETF inflows, Bitcoins price could soon push past its previous ATH.Bitcoin is Ready To Bounce BackSponsoredSponsoredThe Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Ratio spiked earlier this month, following a similar spike in June. The NVT Ratio measures the relationship between the network value and transaction activity.A rising NVT Ratio suggests the network value was exceeding the transaction activity, which generally is a sign of the market overheating. This tends to result in a reversal.The same was evident inBitcoins recent dip, as the market cooled off. Nevertheless, currently, the NVT Ratio has returned to a monthly low, providing Bitcoin with room for a potential rally.SponsoredSponsoredFor token TA and market updates: Want more token insights like this?

Source:GlassnodeThis week, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw over 1.5 billion in inflows, a significant portion of which occurred in the last 48 hours during Bitcoins dip. The influx of institutional money highlights that investors are confident in Bitcoins potential despite the market cooling.These ETF inflows demonstrate resilience among institutional investors, who are continuing to add Bitcoin to their portfolios rather than sell. If this trend persists, it could propelBitcoins price upward, as institutional support provides stability.Bitcoin Spot ETF Flows. Source:FarsideBTC Price Is Inches From The All-Time HighSponsoredSponsoredBitcoin is currentlytrading at 118,325, facing resistance at the 120,000 level. This resistance is crucial for Bitcoin if it wants to break back to its ATH of 123,218. The 4.1 gap to reach the ATH indicates potential for growth, but Bitcoin needs to secure support above 120,000 for this to happen.If Bitcoin can hold above 120,000 and push past 122,000, it could continue its ascent toward new all-time highs. The current market conditions and ETF inflows support a bullish outlook, with a significant chance of breaking the resistance.Bitcoin Price Analysis. Source:TradingViewHowever, the risk of profit-taking remains, which could lead to a price drop. IfBitcoin faces selling pressure, it could fall back to 115,000, erasing a portion of recent gains. This would invalidate the bullish thesis, causing Bitcoin to retest lower support levels.Best crypto platforms in EuropeBTSEExploreYouHodlerExploreNEXOExploreWirexExploreMEXCExploreBest crypto platforms in EuropeBTSEExploreYouHodlerExploreNEXOExploreWirexExploreMEXCExploreBest crypto platforms in EuropeBTSEYouHodlerNEXOWirexMEXCDisclaimerIn line with theTrust Projectguidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

          "cleaned_content": "In Brief\nBitcoin faces resistance at 120,000, with a 4.1 gap to break its ATH, supported by 1.5 billion ETF inflows.\nThe NVT ratio has cooled down, providing Bitcoin room for a potential rally despite recent pullback and ETF support.\nInstitutional ETF inflows show resilience, as 1.5 billion inflows in the last 48 hours could propel Bitcoin towards ATH.\n\nBitcoin recently reached a new all-time high (ATH) but encountered a brief pullback as the market overheated. However, with the resilience in the ETF market, Bitcoin has largely returned to normalcy. With substantial ETF inflows, Bitcoin's price could soon push past its previous ATH.\n\nBitcoin is Ready To Bounce Back\nThe Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Ratio spiked earlier this month, following a similar spike in June. The NVT Ratio measures the relationship between the network value and transaction activity. A rising NVT Ratio suggests the network value was exceeding the transaction activity, which generally is a sign of the market overheating. This tends to result in a reversal. The same was evident in Bitcoin's recent dip, as the market cooled off. Nevertheless, currently, the NVT Ratio has returned to a monthly low, providing Bitcoin with room for a potential rally.\n\nFor token TA and market updates: Want more token insights like this?

Source: Glassnode\n\nThis week, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw over 1.5 billion in inflows, a significant portion of which occurred in the last 48 hours during Bitcoin's dip. The influx of institutional money highlights that investors are confident in Bitcoin's potential despite the market cooling. These ETF inflows demonstrate resilience among institutional investors, who are continuing to add Bitcoin to their portfolios rather than sell. If this trend persists, it could propel Bitcoin's price upward, as institutional support provides stability.\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Flows. Source: Farside\n\nBTC Price Is Inches From The All-Time High\nBitcoin is currently trading at 118,325, facing resistance at the 120,000 level. This resistance is crucial for Bitcoin if it wants to break back to its ATH of 123,218. The 4.1 gap to reach the ATH indicates potential for growth, but Bitcoin needs to secure support above 120,000 for this to happen. If Bitcoin can hold above 120,000 and push past 122,000, it could continue its ascent toward new all-time highs. The current market conditions and ETF inflows support a bullish outlook, with a significant chance of breaking the resistance.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, the risk of profit-taking remains, which could lead to a price drop. If Bitcoin faces selling pressure, it could fall back to 115,000, erasing a portion of recent gains. This would invalidate the bullish thesis, causing Bitcoin to retest lower support levels.\n\nDisclaimer\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

The token soared to a local high of 0.006899 on July 16, riding Solanas meme coin wave and renewed market attention.But within hours, the PUMP price collapsed to a low of 0.005294, marking a sharp 23.2 drop. The steep correction comes amid heavy profit-taking by early holders, and signs suggest further downside pressure unless key levels are reclaimed.Smart Money Starts Dumping as Realized Profits SurgeThe latest on-chain data reveals an aggressive round of profit-taking by top holders. According to PnL data, the top 10 wallets alone realized over 17 million in profits, with the leaderboard showing traders cashing out completely.SponsoredSponsoredWallet CxSZ84Ui booked 1.79 million, while eight others followed with 1.5 million or more in realized gains. Notably, over 95 of top wallets are now holding 0 of their initial positions, signaling total exits.PUMP price and aggressive profit booking:NansenMeanwhile, smart money wallets, wallets tagged for high win rates, have seen a 34.5 drop in holdings, now sitting at 3.17 billion tokens, down from over 4.3 billion earlier in the day. The balance forPUMPwhale wallets also slipped by 3.63, suggesting that large players arent just watching; theyre actively selling.That means thePUMP buybacksimply hasnt outweighed sustained sell pressure. Fees spent on repurchases are being canceled out or even surpassed by profit-taking from whales unloading huge stakes.PUMP holders and their 24-hour moves:NansenSponsoredSponsoredOn the flip side, the unrealized PUMP profit leaderboard reveals a dangerous setup: wallets still holding nearly 10 million in paper gains. For instance, wallet 9mKy1K8S shows 1.38 million in unrealized profit with 100 still held, indicating that these traders could become the next wave of sellers if the price weakens further. Or they might just be the reason for a deeper PUMP price weakening stint.Unrealized profits signal caution:NansenSupertrend Flips Bearish, Matching Whale Exit BehaviorThe Supertrend indicator has now turned red on the 1-hour chart  a sign that the short-term trend has flipped bearish. This lines up with what were already seeing from large wallet holders. After riding the rally, whales have started pulling out, and that exit seems to be dragging the price down.PUMP Supertrend indicator:TradingViewSponsoredSponsoredWhen big players stop buying, and the trend indicator also flips, its often a sign that more downside could be ahead.For those unfamiliar, the Supertrend is a trend-following indicator that reacts to both price andvolatility. When the price falls below a certain range, the line flips from green to red, signaling a shift from bullish to bearish momentum.PUMP Price Risks Breakdown Below Key SupportThe price chart tells a clearer story. Weve drawn Fibonacci retracement levels from the local high at 0.00689 to the swing low at 0.00529. As of writing, thePUMP priceis trading around 0.00535, dangerously close to breaking below the Fibonacci base (0.0 level).SponsoredSponsoredKey levels have already been breached.

          "cleaned_content": "In Brief\nPUMP has dropped 23% in just hours, raising panic.\nTop wallets already cashed out over 17 million.\nIf Pump breaks 0.005294, a deeper fall could follow.\n\nPUMP's native token, PUMP, is showing signs of exhaustion after a dramatic breakout. The token soared to a local high of 0.006899 on July 16, riding Solana's meme coin wave and renewed market attention.\n\nBut within hours, the PUMP price collapsed to a low of 0.005294, marking a sharp 23.2% drop. The steep correction comes amid heavy profit-taking by early holders, and signs suggest further downside pressure unless key levels are reclaimed.\n\nSmart Money Starts Dumping as Realized Profits Surge\nThe latest on-chain data reveals an aggressive round of profit-taking by top holders. According to PnL data, the top 10 wallets alone realized over 17 million in profits, with the leaderboard showing traders cashing out completely.\n\nWallet CxSZ84Ui booked 1.79 million, while eight others followed with 1.5 million or more in realized gains. Notably, over 95% of top wallets are now holding 0% of their initial positions, signaling total exits.\n\nMeanwhile, smart money wallets, wallets tagged for high win rates, have seen a 34.5% drop in holdings, now sitting at 3.17 billion tokens, down from over 4.3 billion earlier in the day. The balance for PUMP whale wallets also slipped by 3.63%, suggesting that large players aren't just watching; they're actively selling.\n\nThat means the PUMP buybacks simply haven't outweighed sustained sell pressure. Fees spent on repurchases are being canceled out or even surpassed by profit-taking from whales unloading huge stakes.\n\nOn the flip side, the unrealized PUMP profit leaderboard reveals a dangerous setup: wallets still holding nearly 10 million in paper gains. For instance, wallet 9mKy1K8S shows 1.38 million in unrealized profit with 100% still held, indicating that these traders could become the next wave of sellers if the price weakens further. Or they might just be the reason for a deeper PUMP price weakening stint.\n\nSupertrend Flips Bearish, Matching Whale Exit Behavior\nThe Supertrend indicator has now turned red on the 1-hour chart—a sign that the short-term trend has flipped bearish. This lines up with what we're already seeing from large wallet holders. After riding the rally, whales have started pulling out, and that exit seems to be dragging the price down.\n\nWhen big players stop buying, and the trend indicator also flips, it's often a sign that more downside could be ahead.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the Supertrend is a trend-following indicator that reacts to both price and volatility. When the price falls below a certain range, the line flips from green to red, signaling a shift from bullish to bearish momentum.\n\nPUMP Price Risks Breakdown Below Key Support\nThe price chart tells a clearer story. We've drawn Fibonacci retracement levels from the local high at 0.00689 to the swing low at 0.00529. As of writing, the PUMP price is trading around 0.00535, dangerously close to breaking below the Fibonacci base (0.0 level).\n\nKey levels have already been breached. The 0.382 retracement at 0.00590 and the 0.236 level at 0.00567 failed to hold as support. If 0.00529 breaks, it opens up the risk of cascading selloffs, especially with so many wallets still in unrealized profit territory.\n\nThe bearish thesis holds unless bulls can reclaim the 0.618 Fibonacci level at 0.00628, which now acts as the strongest resistance/support. A clean break above that could signal buyer re-entry and set up a retest of 0.00689.\n\nDisclaimer\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
