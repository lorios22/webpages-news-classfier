We only engaged with third-party entities to explore potential global expansion. No business was ever conducted by CoinDCX(Neblio Technologies)in Lithuania, and no user funds were ever moved to or held by any Lithuania-based entity, Gupta said.He added that the exchange updated its Terms of Use to make Neblio Technologies the formal contracting party on Feb. 7 this year, and the change was made to strengthen transparency and user trust.We did this proactively so that CoinDCX users never face challenges like those seen during the WazirX episode. This approach safeguards users interests, and we hope other Indian exchanges adopt the same standard, Gupta said, adding that the exchange remains committed, as always, to user safety, transparency, and regulatory compliance.WazirXIndiaExclusiveOmkar GodboleOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesks Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

Tether says the usage of USDT on these networks, which it touts as playing a role in the firms early growth, has declined significantly over the past two years.Sunsetting support for these legacy chains allows us to focus on platforms that offer greater scalability, developer activity, and community engagement  all key components for driving the next wave of stablecoin adoption, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in the statement.The firm will redirect its focus to Layer 2 networks such as the Lightning Network and to newer blockchains that promise faster settlement and richer developer tooling.Tether has asked its customers holding USDT on the five networks to redeem their holdings as soon as possible or request issuance of their tokens on a supported blockchain. Token holders can migrate their tokens through blockchain bridges or exchanges.The lions share of Tethers 156 billion fiat is currently circulating on Tron and Ethereum, which together make up over 95 of the total.

XRP volumes have spiked on Korean exchanges, while Cardano, TRX, and AVAX are all trading firmly in the green.ByShaurya MalwaUpdatedJul 12, 2025, 7:34 a.m.PublishedJul 12, 2025, 7:34 a.m.What to know:Bitcoin surged to 120,000, leading to significant gains in other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin.Institutional influence is shaping the market, with Bitcoin emerging as a macro hedge amid tight monetary policy and geopolitical volatility.Ethereum and Solana have seen notable increases, while XRP and Dogecoin have experienced substantial rallies driven by technical breakouts and retail participation.Bitcoins rally to 120,000 this week has sparked a broader breakout across major crypto assets, with ether(ETH), Solanas SOL, XRP, and dogecoinDOGE0.2019all posting high single-digit percentage gains.However, this time, price action isnt just about momentum, as traders claim that market structure is evolving under the weight of institutional influence.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.This isnt a frenzied boom with no foundation, said Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank. Its a measured ascent, backed up by large institutional players with the long-term in mind.Rocca pointed to tight monetary policy and geopolitical volatility as reinforcing Bitcoins emerging role as a macro hedge, adding that the momentum weve seen over the last 48 hours is clear. Bitcoin isnt just growing in value, but also as a genuine asset class that is rivalling traditional finance.Ethereum, up over 17 on the week and briefly crossed 3,000, remains a primary beneficiary. In Q2, corporate treasury purchases of BTC outpaced inflows into spot ETFs, said the analytics team at Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash in a note to CoinDesk.That points to strategic positioning. At the same time, custodians like Anchorage and Fidelity are scaling institutional pipelines, while OTC desks are tightening spreads.Solana, now trading around 163, gained over 11 on the week amid renewed demand across retail and memecoin ecosystems. The chain continues to act as a high-beta proxy for risk-on sentiment. XRP, meanwhile, jumped 25, benefiting from both a technical breakout and rising speculation around regulatory resolution.Price action may grab the spotlight, TeraHash added, but the real breakthrough this summer is structural.The altcoin move is broad-based. Dogecoin has rallied 23 over the past week, driven by increased retail participation through platforms like Robinhood and Binance. XRP volumes have spiked on Korean exchanges, while Cardano, TRX, and AVAX are all trading firmly in the green.Meanwhile, Bitpanda Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that strong bitcoin rallies are often followed by significant movements in altcoins with a slight delay  and a potential comeback of meme coins cant be ruled out either.But not everyone sees a straight line up.Despite briefly touching this key milestone, BTC remains below a major resistance zone, said Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, said in an email.A decisive breakout and sustained move above this level could trigger a sharp upward rally, potentially targeting the 130,000 range, Lienkha added.btcShaurya MalwaShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.Shaurya holds over 1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.He provides over 1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.X iconLatest Crypto NewsIndian Crypto Exchange CoinDCX Denies Moving User Funds After WazirX Allegations18 hours agoStellar Performance From XLM as It Posts Top 24H Percentage Gain Among Top 20 Cryptos20 hours agoAnother BTC Mining Firm Moves Into Ethereum Reserve, Hailing ETH as Digital Gold22 hours agoPump.fun Swiftly Raises 500M in Public Sale at 4B Fully Diluted Valuation23 hours agoTether to Halt USDT on Omni, BCH, Kusama, EOS, Algorand as Focus Shifts to Layer 2s23 hours agoCoinbases Pudgy Penguin Avatar Change, ETF Hopes Ignite 60 PENGU RallyJul 12, 2025Top StoriesPump.fun Swiftly Raises 500M in Public Sale at 4B Fully Diluted Valuat\n                    Source: coindesk\n                    Published: Sat, 12 Jul 2025 07:34:55 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    '}

The House is set to vote on market structure and stablecoin legislation next week, bringing the U.S. a vital step closer to drafting new rules for the industry.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Youre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government.Click hereto sign up for future editions.Crypto winThe narrativeThe U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a market structure bill, a stablecoin bill and a bill banning a U.S. central bank digital currency next week. Perhaps its premature to suggest the industry will notch a major win  but all signs indicate that U.S. President Donald Trump will sign a stablecoin bill into law before the August recess, as his team has sought since February.Why it mattersThe crypto industry has long sought regulatory clarity on its own terms  previous rule proposals it disagreed with wereferventlyopposedand the industrys political action committees poured tens of millions of dollars into the 2024 elections to try and create a Congress that would be friendlier to crypto policies.Next week, those efforts may pay off, as the House of Representatives gets set to vote on a stablecoin bill that may become law within weeks and a market structure bill that could get to the White House before Christmas.Breaking it downThe House of Representatives dubbed next week  July 14 to July 18  Crypto Week. The main event will be the House vote on, and expected passage of, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025(Clarity), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025(GENIUS).The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet Monday at 4:00 p.m. ET todiscusseach ofthe bills. That means there may be a floor vote, where the entire House votes, by Tuesday. Though there was some discussion of packaging the Clarity and GENIUS Acts into one larger bill, it appears there will instead be separate votes for each of the bills. If the GENIUS Act does receive its own vote, U.S. President Donald Trump may sign it into law as soon as next Friday or the following Monday, Im told, though at this point none of this is confirmed(and obviously depends on the actual House vote).Notably, the House Financial Services Committeeconfirmed on Thursdaythat the House would vote on the GENIUS Bill sent to it by the Senate, and not its own Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy(STABLE Act),as previously reportedby CoinDesks Jesse Hamilton.It is likely that all three bills will pass, and with bipartisan majorities.To recap: The Clarity Act will create a framework for how different cryptocurrencies are treated by federal regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Theres no Senate counterpart to this bill yet, though the Senate Banking Committee has already held multiple hearings on market structure issues, and the Senate Agriculture Committee has scheduled a hearing for this upcoming Tuesday on the same topic. Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott previously said he expects the Senate to wrap up its work on market structure by Sept. 30.The Houses last effort to pass market structure legislation, last years Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, sawmassive bipartisan supportwith 279 lawmakers(208 Republicans and 71 Democrats)voting in favor of the bill.While there is no public whip count yet for this years version, the Clarity Act passed out of the House Agriculture Committee with massive bipartisan support(47-6)and the House Financial Services Committee with some bipartisan support(32-19).Either numbersuggests both Democrats and Republicans will vote for the bill on the House floor.The GENIUS Act will set up a framework for overseeing stablecoins. The Senate already passed the GENIUS Act, meaning once the House passes it, it goes to Trumps desk for his signature into law. This could mark the stablecoin bill as the first major crypto-focused bill to become law.The GENIUS Act could then also be one of the few bills that isnt a must-pass to go through the legislative process, meaning its not a budget bill and its not the annual National Defense Authorization Act. While the House is voting on the Senate version and not its own STABLE Act,updated House textin the Clarity Act would add some additional rules around stablecoins.The Anti-CB\n                    Source: coindesk\n                    Published: Fri, 11 Jul 2025 19:54:11 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    "}

The company has spent more than 42 billion accumulating its stash, which makes it the third-largest bitcoin holder. Only the pseudonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and asset manager BlackRock hold more.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.However, BlackRock holds bitcoin on behalf of investors in its iShares Bitcoin Trust(IBIT), which launched in January last year. Strategy, by contrast, holds the tokens on its balance sheet. The firms co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has repeatedly said that he has no intention ofever selling. In fact, during BTCs all-time high run yesterday,he gloated, The halls of eternity echo with the cries of those who sold their Bitcoin, in an X post.And who can blame him? After all, his companys BTC holdings far outpace those of every publicly traded company.Top 10 public bitcoin treasury companies and their value at 117k (BitcoinTreasuries.NetChatGPT)Other corporate bitcoin holders are also seeing their balances swell. Japanese firm Metaplanet(3350), which began aggressively accumulating BTC in 2024, now owns 15,555 coins worth roughly 1.83 billion. That translates to an unrealized profitof 284 million.Meanwhile, El Salvador, the first nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender,holds 6,234 BTCworth nearly 733 million at current prices. Its bitcoin bet has turned into a 232 million paper gain, a significant reversal from the losses it faced during the 2022 bear market.Smaller firms are riding the rally too. Semler Scientific(SMLR), which followed Strategys treasury strategy last year, owns 4,636 BTC and sits on160 million in unrealized gains. Frances Blockchain Group(ALTBG)holds 900 BTC, and still has30.5 million in gains on paper.While these companies could lock in massive profits by selling, most havent budged. In the bitcoin community, many of these holders are known as maxis  short for maximalists  who believe in holding the asset indefinitely. Some may take profits over time, but others, like Saylor, have stated publicly they plan to hold forever.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards.For more information, seeCoinDesks full AI Policy.MicroStrategyMetaPlanetSemler scientificHelene BraunHelene is a New York-based markets reporter at CoinDesk, covering the latest news from Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds and updates on crypto markets.

Shares were sold at 4.00 each, with management purchasing at a premium of 4.94. The company said the equity deal is expected to close around July 14.Separately, Upexi entered into agreements to issue 150 million in convertible notes to institutional investors. The notes are backed by SOL as collateral and carry a 2 annual interest rate. They are convertible into Upexi stock at a fixed price of 4.25 per share and mature in 24 months. The notes are expected to close around July 16, at which point the associated SOL will be added to the companys holdings.In a June 26press release, Upexi disclosed that it held 735,692 SOL as of June 24, an 8 increase from the 679,677 SOL reported on May 28. Upon closing of the new financing, Upexi expects to more than double its current SOL position.The offerings were conducted privately and are not registered with the SEC.Technical AnalysisSOL demonstrated exceptional resilience throughout the preceding 24-hour period from 10 July 15:00 to 11 July 14:00, progressing from 156.45 to 166.65, constituting a substantial 6.52 appreciation with an aggregate trading range of 10.99 extending from 155.78 to 166.76.The price dynamics unveiled distinctive accumulation sequences with considerable volume-backed support materialising at 160.31 during the 21:00 hour advancement, where extraordinary volume of 3.23 million substantially surpassed the 24-hour mean of 1.34 million, corroborating institutional capital deployment.Pivotal resistance emerged proximate to 165.30, subjected to multiple examinations between 22:00 and 03:00, whilst the conclusive breakthrough above 166.00 transpired with amplified volume of 2.26 million, intimating persistent bullish conviction.The technical architecture suggests SOL has consolidated a superior trading corridor with robust volume validation, establishing foundations for prospective advancement towards the 170.00 psychological threshold.Throughout the concluding 60-minute interval from 11 July 13:05 to 14:04, SOL encountered considerable volatility whilst preserving its overarching bullish disposition, oscillating within a 2.90 bandwidth from 164.24 to 166.76 and settling at 165.87, representing a marginal 0.44 contraction from the hours commencement at 165.92.The period manifested quintessential consolidation attributes encompassing two discrete phases: an initial retreat to 164.28 circa 13:33 accompanied by intensified distribution pressure of 45,017 volume, succeeded by a vigorous recovery commencing at 13:48 where volume escalated to 81,740 during the ascent towards 166.76, validating renewed accumulation interest.Fundamental support crystallised near 164.30 with multiple successful examinations, whilst resistance materialised around 166.50-166.75, establishing a well-delineated trading corridor that suggests constructive price discovery following the antecedent 24-hour advance, positioning SOL for potential continuation of its broader upward trajectory upon completion of this consolidation phase.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance fro\n                    Source: coindesk\n                    Published: Fri, 11 Jul 2025 16:04:19 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    '}

It was the first time since early 2021 that downgrades outpaced upgrades in dollar terms, and more companies are at risk of being demoted later this year as economic uncertainty rises, JPMorgan strategists including Eric Beinstein and Silvi Mantri wrote this week.The economy faces unknowns now including whether trade wars will keep escalating. But corporate bond valuations are high, with US investment-grade spreads this week hovering around 0.8 percentage point, well below the two-decade average of around 1.5 percentage point. For junk securities, spreads are closer to about 2.8 percentage points, far short of the 4.9 percentage point average going back 20 years. That makes picking the right bonds crucial.Credit picking is super important now. You have to get your calls right, said Jon Curran, head of investment grade credit at Principal Asset Management, in an interview. The vulnerability to downgrades is higher.There are other reasons to be worried about credit quality now. High-yield borrowers are delaying about 9 of interest payments globally, known as paying in kind, according to JPMorgan Asset Managements Oksana Aronov, up from about 4 in 2020. And cash balances at high-grade US companies are showing signs of starting to fall. The second quarter earnings season begins in the US in the coming week, and will give more insight as to how companies are faring.Pacific Investment Management Co., overseeing 2 trillion, has been cautious in industries like retail that are facing long-term decline or those exposed to near-term risk of boosting borrowings, like metals and mining, homebuilders and autos, according to Sonali Pier, multi-sector credit portfolio manager at Pimco. Shes leaning into sectors likely to continue to benefiting from strong free cash flow and earnings growth trends, like banks and pipeline companies and more defensive sectors like healthcare, utilities and defense.Story ContinuesWeve maintained a light footprint in areas of the market where we foresee more downgrade and fallen angel risk, said Pier.Many investors are optimistic that company credit will generally remain strong. Overall US corporate yields remain high by the standards of the last decade. Portfolio managers in the US and Europe are selling default protection at an increasing pace, a signal they see little risk on the horizon. Their position on the main investment-grade US credit-default swap index now amounts to over 105 billion, the most in at least three years, based on data compiled by Barclays Plc and Bloomberg. Its a similar story in Europe.But by at least some measures, including not just ratings downgrades but also companies losing investment-grade status, the outlook is deteriorating. In the second quarter, there were about 34 billion of debt known as Fallen Angels, or bonds cut to junk, compared with just 3 billion of rising stars, JPMorgan strategists said. And on Friday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 35 tariff on some Canadian goods, ramping up his trade rhetoric.Businesses are vulnerable to tariffs but also living with uncertainty, said Christina Padgett, head of leveraged finance and private credit research at Moodys Ratings. Its not confirmed for a lot of businesses what their fate is.Week In ReviewA pre-summer frenzy in junk loans is seeing the market start to overheat, prompting investors to get a bit more picky about deals after spreads reached the tightest levels in years.Nissan Motor Co. raised 4.5 billion from a junk-bond sale in US dollar and euros, with the embattled automaker offering a record-high coupon on at least one part of the deal to drum up demand.Japanese telecom giant NTT Inc. sold 17.7 billion of dollar and euro bonds, marking the biggest-ever offering by an Asian corporate in the global debt market.Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS Group AG have begun early pricing discussions with investors for a 4.25 billion debt package to help finance Sycamore Partners buyout of UK pharmacy Boots.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BBVA SA are among a group of lenders providing 500 million (584 million) of debt to back Warburg Pincus buyout of a majority stake in Uvex Group.A \n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Sat, 12 Jul 2025 19:00:00 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: macro\n                    '}

Circle's revenue is highly dependent on factors completely outside of its control.  Since its initial public offering (IPO) last month, Circle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL) stock has skyrocketed 140% as excitement builds around the possibility that stablecoins could see widespread adoption across traditional finance.\n                    Content: Since its initial public offering (IPO) last month,Circle Internet Group(CRCL-7.84)stock has skyrocketed 140 as excitement builds around the possibility that stablecoins could see widespread adoption across traditional finance. Considering the company issuesUSDC(USDC0.00), one of the most popular stablecoins around, many investors believe Circles stock is just getting started. So, could Circle Internet be a millionaire maker?Stablecoins keep things steadyStablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies designed to hold their valuerelative to a traditional fiat currency -- often the U.S. dollar. Where coins likeBitcoinandDogecoinare subject to dramatic swings in price, stablecoins are intended to never deviate more than a small fraction of a percent from the currency they are pegged to.Though other crypto ventures have tried more complicated mechanisms, Circle maintains USDCs peg to the U.S. dollar by simply holding 1 in cash or short-term Treasury papers for every USDC it issues. Any USDC in circulation is redeemable at any time for 1 in cash.So what is the point? USDC and other stablecoins provide many of the benefits of certain cryptocurrencies -- transactions are fast, cheap, and nearly frictionless -- without the fear of wild price swings. Like cash, theyre intended to be used, not hoarded.Circles revenue comes from TreasuriesDespite the shiny technology exterior, Circles revenue stream is simple. The company makes money through holding U.S. Treasuries. Circle, much like a bank, knows that only a fraction of all the USDC in circulation will be redeemed at any one time, so it only needs to keep a portion of reserves in cash to be instantaneously redeemable by USDC holders. It invests the rest in short-term U.S. Treasuries. Thats still a relatively liquid asset, but one that earns Circle interest income.This is functionally the entirety of Circles revenue source; of the 1.68 billion revenues the company collected in 2024, 1.66 billion was from reserve interest. So, to be clear, Circles revenue is directly tied to two main factors: how many USDC are in circulation (and therefore the size of the reserves from which it is earning interest) and U.S. Treasury rates.Stablecoins could be bigThere are currently 62.8 billion USDC in circulation. The company believes that it will grow significantly as adoption progresses throughout the wider economy.Theres ample reason to believe that is true. The GENIUS Act, a landmark bill that creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins and allows for their use in the banking industry, is working its way through Congress. Though some of the finer details may change, its more than likely it will be signed into law this year as its one of the few pieces of legislation today that has robust bipartisan support.Image source: Getty Images.An analysis fromCitilays out a bear, base, and bull case for the stablecoin market through 2030. Its base case sees roughly 1.6 trillion stablecoins in circulation five years from now, up from todays 234 billion. There is clearly a massive potential here.Its also likely that USDC captures a significant portion of this total market. Its currently second only toTether, but its rival wouldnt qualify under the GENIUS Act -- its reserve practices are somewhat opaque, and it uses volatile assets like Bitcoin as collateral. That puts USDC in a prime position.There are some serious complications, howeverThere are some key things to consider that complicate the issue, however. First, I think USDC could face significant competition not from Tether or other crypto native issuers, but from legacy institutions. Its been reported that some of the largest banks, likeJP Morgan ChaseandBank of America, have been in talks to create their own stablecoins. This would undermine the core of USDCs growth thesis. Circle and USDC could even face an official U.S. dollarcentral bank digital currency(CBDC) issued by the Federal Reserve itself.Heres another thing to consider. Circles revenue is directly tied to yields from U.S. Treasuries, which in turn are tied to the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. We are in an environment of relatively high interest rates, at least in the context of recent history.If rates are cut, which they likely will be later this year, Circles income will take a hit. According to an analysis by Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at the firm Fundstrat, every 0.25 drop in the Feds rate will equal a 10 drop in Circles revenue. Thats pretty significant.While I think stablecoin adoption will grow, I think investors are getting ahead of themselves. Right now, the stock is overvalued. I think that there aretoo many long-term risks and not enough of a moatto call Circle a millionaire-maker.\n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Sat, 12 Jul 2025 17:07:00 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: macro\n                    "}

Theinitial pricealso rose from 25 to 31 per share, boosting Circles first-day market cap from 600 million to 1.05 billion.But that still wasnt enough. Circles stock price rose all the way to 103.75 per share on the first day of active trading. In other words, investor interest was red-hot.And it hasnt cooled down much. Circles stock closed this Thursdays trading session at 202.90 per share.Circle Internets stablecoin expertiseWhy am I talking about a popular (and arguably underpriced) stock sale in this stablecoin analysis? Because thats Circle Internets bread and butter.Circle Internets flagship product isUSDC(USDC0.00). Its one of the largest and most active U.S. dollar stablecoins on the market today, co-managed by Circle Internet and crypto-trading services veteranCoinbase Global.USDC is available on many crypto exchanges worldwide, but its main function is to make Coinbases trading system run smoothly. There are 62.8 billion USDC coins available today, with a daily transaction volume of 15.6 billion. In the filings leading up to Circle Internets stock offering, management claimed that 25 trillion had changed hands in the seven-year lifetime of USDC.And its a surprisingly profitable venture. A digital coin thats always worth a dollar may not sound like a cash machine, but Circle collected 19.5 billion of financing cash flow and 345 million of cash from operations in 2024. The company backs its digital assets with an equal amount of cash reserves, which generate income by being invested in ultra-safe securities. You know,like any old bank.Stablecoin heavyweightsCircle Internet is not the only stablecoin game in town. Perhaps inspired by the USDC backers impressive financial filings and moneymaking initial public offering (IPO), a plethora of surprising names are stepping into the stablecoin arena.The list includes some of the worlds largest banks, giant credit card processorsMastercardandVisa, and online payments expertPayPal-- just to name a few. Some of these classic financial powerhouses are launching their own stablecoins. Others are partnering up with Circle Internet and other specialists, and a few are simply embracing the use of existing stablecoins. Either way, old-school bankers are suddenly getting mighty comfortable with the concept of encrypted ledgers of digital transactions -- the core concept behind every stablecoin.Whats next for stablecoins?Stablecoins are making their way into everyday financial transactions. The coins themselves will not see price increases from this trend, but their backers might get generous as stablecoin management becomes increasingly profitable.Coinbase offers rewards for holding USDC coins, similar to a 4.1 annual interest rate. Other coins and different platforms offer even higher interest rates. The stablecoins are not always as rock-solid as USDC, so you have to calculate your appetite for digital currency risks before jumping into those potentially lucrative accounts. But interest rates and other owner-friendly features may become more attractive and profitable over time.Meanwhile, I expect the explosion of new stablecoins to continue for a while. It will slow down and stop someday, perhaps reversing for a while as the stablecoin market simplifies itself to a handful of preferred coins. This process will take years, though. For now, I just cant wait to see Circle Internets firstfinancial report as a public company, and Ill keep an eye on follow-up IPO announcements in the space.\n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Sat, 12 Jul 2025 15:27:00 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    "}

The remark added to growing criticism of the Fed chair by Trump, who has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts and signaled he may nominate a successor before Powells term ends.Powell has resisted pressure to ease monetary policy and said he wont step down if asked by the president, given the Feds independence. While acknowledging cost overruns related to the renovation work, Powell has disputed portions of reports about the issue and called them flatly misleading.George Saravelos, Deutsches global head of FX strategy, said in a report to clients that the market is pricing a very low probability of Powell being removed from office. He pointed to Polymarket, a betting platform, which assigned less than a 20 chance of it happening, and noted that the dollar has been broadly stable recently.If Trump were to force Powell out, the subsequent 24 hours would probably see a drop of at least 3 to 4 in the trade-weighted dollar, as well as a 30 to 40 basis point fixed-income selloff, Saravelos said. The greenback and bonds would carry a persistent risk premium, he said, adding that investors may also grow anxious about the potential politicization of the Feds swap lines with other central banks.Investors would likely interpret such an event as a direct affront to Fed independence, putting the central bank under extreme institutional duress, Saravelos said. With the Fed sitting at the pinnacle of the global dollar monetary system, it is also stating the obvious that the consequences would reverberate far beyond US borders.How markets continue to react beyond the initial news would depend on whether other Fed officials publicly coalesced around the central banks independence, Trumps nomination for Powells successor and the state of the economy, Saravelos said.Beyond that, we worry about the very vulnerable external funding position which the US economy currently finds itself in, he said. This raises the risk of far larger and more disruptive price moves than the ones we have outlined.Story ContinuesIn another report, ING Groep NV strategists including Padhraic Garvey said an early exit by Powell was unlikely, but would lead to a steepening of the Treasury yield curve as investors priced in lower rates, faster inflation and diminished Fed independence.They said it would also create a toxic mix for the dollar, with the euro, yen and Swiss franc set to benefit most.--With assistance from Esteban Duarte.(Updates with ING strategists comments in final paragraphs.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOur Goal Is to Get Their Money: Inside a Firm Charged With Scamming Writers for MillionsTrumps Cuts Are Making Federal Data DisappearSoccer Players Are Being Seriously OverworkedWill Trade War Make South India the Next Manufacturing Hub?Trade War?

TheLas Vegas Review-Journalrecently reported that a record 7 billion worth of homes are currently for sale in theLas Vegasvalley. According to the newspaper, housing data from Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN), paints a picture of a real estate market experiencing a sharp correction.The Review-Journal used Multiple Listing Service data to show that the median price of the homes sold in the Las Vegas valley was 480,000 in May. Thats not too far from the all-time high of 485,000. Ironically, that high price point may be part of why the market is slowing down. For much of the past several decades, the major appeal of Las Vegasreal estatehas been affordability.Dont Miss:Warren Buffett once said, If you dont find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die. Hereshow you can earn passive income with just 10, starting today.100k in investable assets?Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes no cost, no obligation.Those low prices lured frustrated home buyers who were frozen out of Californias most expensive markets. They combined with low interest rates to make Las Vegas a very dynamic market for the last several decades. Las Vegas became one of the hottest real estate markets in the U.S. sunbelt, and property appreciation followed. Even now, a median sale price of 480,000 is only about 40,000 more thanRedfinsnational median sale price of 440,913.However, higher interest rates have changed the equation for many buyers. If rates ever come down again, sales will pick up. I just pulled an inventory report, and we are at almost four months of inventory on the resale side of the market, ReMax Legacy agentDale Jonestold the Review-Journal. So, while still a sellers market, they are worried because their home is not selling as quickly anymore.Jones also voiced concerns that the Las Vegas Valley could be turning into a buyers market because. He told the Review-Journal that regular buyers are increasingly being replaced by bargain-hunting investors with deep pockets. Some of that is certainly attributable to the interest rates, but there is another aspect of the equation that no one in Las Vegas saw coming: growing consumer unease with the economy.Trending: Its no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over 250 million in art this alternative asset has outpaced the SP 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4. Heres how everyday investors are getting started.PresidentDonald Trumps economic policies have pushed the dollar to a three-year low and dented consumer confidence. Numerous economic indicators are pointing towards a looming recession. Worries about how Trumps tariffs will affect the economy and high interest rates are clearly taking a toll on Las Vegas real estate market.Story ContinuesIf youre buying or selling a home right now, youve probably noticed something, its a challenging market, Las Vegas area mortgage advisorMatt Hennesseytold the Review-Journal. Mortgage rates are still elevated, causing homes to sit on the market longer. When that happens, many buyers and sellers jump to one conclusion, price reduction. But heres the thing, dropping the price doesnt fix the biggest problem buyers are facing right now, monthly home affordability.Mortgage lenders usually require buyers to earn three times the total payment to qualify for a loan. Elevated interest rates and Las Vegas 480,000 median sale price are proving to be high hurdles. Jones thinks that could open the door for speculators. Time for the sharks to start circling, there is blood in the water again, and sellers are scared. We will see the rise in bulk purchasing investors again soon, he said.Read Next:In terms of getting money back,these bank accounts put traditional checking and savings accounts to shame.Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83  Investors like Bill OReilly and Rudy Giuliani areusing this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.Image: ShutterstockThis articleLas Vegas Struggles With A Record 7 Billion Worth Of Homes On The Marketoriginally appeared onBenzinga.comTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info\n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Sat, 12 Jul 2025 00:00:05 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: macro\n                    "}

However, people who are in underbanked communities without access to a viable fiat currency may want to use cryptocurrencies for their purchases. Crypto as a whole benefits this group greatly, since they can avoid fiat currencies withhigh inflation ratesand can transfer money overseas instantly without any of the high fees that financial institutions charge.Will More Stores Accept Cryptocurrencies?Many businesses react to changes in consumer demand and preferences, so it should be no surprise to see additional retailers open up to crypto purchases in the future. Amazon and Walmart are currentlyexperimenting with their own stablecoins, further highlighting how cryptocurrencies will change finance forever.Its not just a good deal for you to make purchases with crypto. By making crypto transactions more common, retailers get to avoid the high fees that credit card companies charge on each transaction. It makes financial sense for businesses to accept crypto purchases, and with the asset becoming more mainstream, these types of purchases may become more common.It also helps that financial institutions have been loading up on Bitcoin andoffering Bitcoin ETFs. This strong demand for Bitcoin has resulted in less dramatic price swings for the digital asset than investors have been used to over the years. Bitcoins market cap is currently above 2 trillion, so its less subject to dramatic price movements, and that can boost the assets appeal.More From GOBankingRates6 Costco Products That Have the Most Customer ComplaintsMark Cuban Warns of Red Rural Recession -- 4 States That Could Get Hit Hard9 Downsizing Tips for the Middle Class To Save on Monthly ExpensesThe New Retirement Problem Boomers Are FacingThis article originally appeared onGOBankingRates.com:50 Stores Where You Can Pay With CryptoTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info\n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Fri, 11 Jul 2025 21:01:11 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    '}

At this point, its hard to imagine what could still rattle the investor class.Speculative spirits were on display again this week, even as President Donald Trump escalated threats against major trading partners, including a 35 tariff on Canadian goods and a 50 levy on copper. Bitcoin surged past 118,000, bond volatility fizzled, stocks held near records and retail traders unleashed risky wagers anew.Its a form of investor resilience, built by facing down threats and emerging stronger  where even the prospect of a renewed US-led trade conflict gets brushed aside, in favor of bullish bets across the board.JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie Dimon has a different word for it: complacency. But for traders sitting on fattening profits in crypto, tech, leveraged ETFs, commodities and beyond, its feeling like vindication.We absolutely believe the recent bullish price action in risk assets makes sense, said Max Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC. Bear in mind this is no longer just equities but spreading across virtually all risk assets. So if anything, wed argue investors are once again under-exposed and continue to fight the rally.Traders are getting harder to frighten even as measures that presaged past market stress climb. A global trade policy uncertainty index tracked by Bloomberg is rising, just as it did in the months before Aprils global market meltdown.The SP 500 closed Friday marginally below its record. Risk premiums tracking US corporate bonds hovered around their lowest level of the year. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds continued to see inflows. Volatility receded, with a gauge of US Treasury swings hitting its lowest level in nearly 3 12 years as measures of stocks. Oil and gold turbulence remained subdued.And yet, Trump warned this week that new and higher rates will kick in Aug. 1, unless countries negotiate better terms. The announcement of a 35 tariff on some Canadian goods came the same day the SP 500 hit its all-time high.The market has consistently shrugged off any issues, including tariffs, and even the brief conflict between Israel and Iran, said Josh Kutin, head of multi-asset solutions, North America at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. If the market is not overall responding negatively to any of those issues, I have a hard time seeing how that happens in the near-term.Story ContinuesKutin says the administrations habit of backing off when markets react badly to trade policies keeps him calm  and on the lookout for tactical opportunities to add equity exposure. Indicators across several portfolios continue to flash bullish signals, he says, driven by strong momentum and relatively low volatility. And while acknowledging the current state can feel toppy, he believes the rally has room to run.The view reflects an increasingly common bet across Wall Street, known as the TACO trade, for Trump Always Chickens Out. The wager is that either the administration will walk back its tariff threats, or the upshot of the offensive simply wont be enough to derail the expanding US economy. Whatever the reasoning, bullishness is prevailing.Trump took to social media this week to celebrate record highs in tech and industrial stocks, as well as an unstoppable crypto runup that sent Bitcoin soaring to 118,000. That market confidence  forged in an environment that has repeatedly punished skeptics  has made some investment pros queasy.People are getting a little bit too comfortable with this idea that Trumps always going to back down, said David Lebovitz, the global strategist of multi-asset solutions at JPMorgan Asset Management. Weve gone from a world where nobody knew anything to everybody knows something. Its almost like the markets going to go through this stress test where they see how far they can push it until they begin to see those cracks.Complacency was also invoked by his boss, JPMorgans Dimon, as stocks hit record highs amid the deluge of tariff news this week. He said a trade framework with Europe still needs to get done, and that the Federal Reserve is far more likely to raise interest rates than is generally believed in markets.The rally has gone way too far, said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Man Group. The tariff situation is far from resolved.

Youre looking at prices being anywhere from 8 to as high as 14 higher across the board, especially in Europe, due to the weakness of the U.S. dollar.DOLLAR SLIDES TO 3-YEAR LOW ON REPORT TRUMP PLANS TO NAME NEXT FED CHAIR EARLYTo put it in perspective, the U.S. dollar has been on a multiyear tear, so weve really benefited the last couple of years  its just with the way things are now, prices are going to be slightly higher than they have been the past couple of years for Americanstraveling to Europespecifically and also Asia, especially Japan, he said.Henderson noted that those who had already locked in prices months ago may not see the impact on that line item of their travel budget  though the dollars decline is likely to still be felt in other aspects of travel spending.Hopefully most folks have already locked in their hotel prices, so theyre not going to be paying a lot more for hotels, he added. Butfood costs, transportation costs everythings going up in price.TRUMP ANNOUNCES HIGHER TARIFF RATES FOR MORE COUNTRIES IN LETTERS PUBLISHED ON SOCIAL MEDIAOne bright spot for travelers budgets can be found in relativelycheaper flightsto and from vacationers destinations, Henderson noted.Clint Henderson of The Points Guy said those who had already locked in prices months ago may not see the impact on that line item of their travel budget.(Bing GuanBloomberg via Getty Images  Getty Images)The good news is, Im calling this the summer of savings when it comes to airfare, because prices are down substantially for airfare, so hopefully any more expense youre paying when youre traveling has been sort of balanced by cheaper airfare, he said.The dollars recent downturn comes after it was relatively stronger thanforeign currenciesin the last few years.TARIFFS WILL REVERT TO APRIL LEVELS IF COUNTRIES DONT MAKE A DEAL BY AUGUST 1, BESSENT SAYSDavid Bahnsen, managing partner and chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, told FOX Business that the main reason is the fact that it had gone up 10 the year before, and in 2025 was just giving that move back.The dollar has declined 10 this year per the Wall Street Journals DXY index.(KAREN BLEIERAFP via Getty Images  Getty Images)The DXY right now is basically where it was three years ago  not higher or lower, though it spent most of the last three years higher than it is now, and it spent most of the ten years before that lower than it is now, he said.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREThe volatility and downward trend the dollar has experienced this year stems from uncertainty overtrade policy and tariffs, as markets take the higher costs into account.The specific catalyst besides the fact that it was over-priced relative to other currencies and due for a correction is this trade and tariff volatility.

Designed to maintain a fixed value, these tokens provide a reliable way for traders to manage risk, reduce transaction fees and even earn passive income.However, not allstablecoinsare created equal, and some carry greater risks than others.These are the largest stablecoins on the market, how they work, their unique features and the potential risks involved.6 largest stablecoins in the worldCoinMarket capTether (USDT)159.1 billionUSDC (USDC)63.13 billionDai (DAI)5.37 billionEthena USDe (USDe)5.33 billionWorld Liberty Financial USD (USD1)2.2 billionFirst Digital (FDUSD)1.45 billion1. Tether (USDT)Market cap:159.1 billionTetheris often hailed as the first successful stablecoin. With 149.27 billion in assets as of March 2025  mostly low-risk U.S. Treasury bills, plus some Bitcoin and gold  Tether is a financial heavyweight. In 2024, Tether brought in 13 billion in profit, or roughly double that of BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager.Tether Holdings, the company behind Tether, issues coins to a select group of direct customers, mostly trading firms. These clients wire real U.S. dollars to Tether, which are then used to purchase assets, mainly U.S. Treasurys, to back the value of the coins.Once in circulation, Tether can be traded for other cryptocurrencies through exchanges and brokerages.Tethers stability was put to the test in May 2022, a key moment in the history of stablecoins. The crash of Terras UST, the third-largest stablecoin at the time, triggered a wave of panic selling that briefly broke Tethers peg, dropping its value to 92 cents on some exchanges. By June 2022, it had rebounded to around 99 cents, and on July 20, 2022, Tether fully regained its dollar peg.2. USDC (USDC)Market cap:63.13 billionUSDC is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, and it operates on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. Its managed by Circle, a financial technology company. USDCs stability is ensured by a reserve of U.S. dollars, where each USDC token is backed by a corresponding dollar held with verified partners, often financial institutions.To create new USDC, users deposit U.S. dollars with Circle, which then issues an equivalent amount of USDC tokens on theblockchain. This process ensures every USDC in the market is backed by a real U.S. dollar.While initially managed by a consortium called Centre, co-founded byCoinbaseand Circle, Circle has since assumed sole responsibility for the management of USDC. However, Coinbase still maintains a minority stake in Circle.Story Continues3. Dai (DAI)Market cap:5.37 billionDai is a decentralized stablecoin operating on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to maintain a stable value of one U.S. dollar through the use of smart contracts and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as MakerDAO.Unlike centralized stablecoins like Tether, Dais issuance and management are decentralized, with no one entity controlling the process. Users can deposit different cryptocurrencies as collateral into smart contracts, which then mint DAI tokens. These collateralized assets help maintain DAIs peg to the U.S. dollar.Dais model has evolved over time. Initially, it relied primarily on Ethereum as collateral. More recently, it has expanded its collateral base to include USDC and real-world assets like U.S. Treasury bills.While supporters say this diversification helps bolster Dais stability, its also generated criticism from some in the crypto community who advocate for apurely decentralized approach.4. Ethena USDe (USDe)Market cap:5.33 billionEthena USDe is a decentralized, synthetic stablecoin that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.Because USDe is decentralized, it doesnt rely on centralized institutions to manage its reserves. Instead, USDe uses whats called cash-and-carry trade, a kind of arbitrage that takes advantage of the price differences between Ethereum and some of itsfinancial derivatives.Heres how it works:Ethena, the parent company of USDe, takes money used to buy USDe and uses that money to buy Ethereum (going long) while simultaneously betting against its price (going short) using financial derivatives.This strategy attempts to neutralize the price risk of USDe, and it offers buyers a yield by staking the Ethereum and collecting payments from the short derivatives positions.This hedging strategy lets USDe keep its dollar value regardless of whether Ethereums price rises or falls. The strategy doesnt come without risk, though. Its short positions could fail if the exchanges where Ethena places these trades collapse or face liquidity issues, such as during a market crash.In fact, USDe has recently faced scrutiny from German regulators that allege Ethena doesnt have enough capital backing for its stablecoin.

Just last month, billionaire investor Tim Drapersaidthe dollar is going extinct while predicting a flight to Bitcoin among retailers in the next decade.Dont Miss:Warren Buffett once said, If you dont find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die. Hereshow you can earn passive income with just 10, starting today.100k in investable assets?Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes no cost, no obligation.According to Blanchard, however, the only way he sees Bitcoin becoming widely accepted as a means of payment is by a presidential mandate. As an example, he said a U.S. president could require all prices and payments to be denominated in Bitcoin. He said that scenarios like these were previously inconceivable, suggesting that his view has shifted with the Trump administrations support of the asset that has culminated inthe establishmentof a strategic national reserve.Blanchard said that in the unlikely event that the shift to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange occurred, it would present two significant macroeconomic implications. For one, he said that the supply of money will be fixed, adding that this type of rigid monetary policy has historically proven to be very bad and fortunately has been abandoned, likely referring to the move away from the gold standard.Society moved away from the gold standard as it offered little flexibility for central banks to intervene in times of crisis, either by injecting more money into the economy or implementing interest rate cuts.Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly dont own yet.See which asset class has outpaced the SP 500 (1995-2024)  and with near-zero correlation.At the same time, Blanchard said that deflation could occur as GDP grows if Bitcoin served as money. Deflation could slow down the economy by discouraging spending. It could also make debts more difficult to pay as the value of money increases.Story ContinuesHopefully, these are just idle speculations, he said. But proponents of Bitcoin as a replacement for the dollar should explain how they handle these issues.Meanwhile, Blanchard is not only skeptical of Bitcoin as money. He has previously questioned the assets value proposition as a hedge in times of uncertainty.A Bubble AssetIn August, BlanchardsaidBitcoin was a bubble asset like gold. This description is rooted ina 1982 paperhe authored with fellow economist Mark Watson called Bubbles, Rational Expectations, and Financial Markets. In the paper, Blanchard and Watson theorize that gold is more susceptible to bubbles than blue chip stocks because its fundamentals are more difficult to assess than a firms financial reports.See Also: In terms of getting money back,these bank accounts put traditional checking and savings accounts to shame.The average investor is more likely to base his choice of whether or not to hold the asset on the basis of past actual returns, rather than on the basis of market fundamentals, they said. Simply put, investors buy in because they believe the asset will go up because it has increased in the past, which sums up why many people hold Bitcoin.Blanchard said that despite the potential for irrational valuation, one could justify holding gold because it has historically performed well in bad times. On the other hand, he said that Bitcoin has failed to show similar strength in times of uncertainty.Despite Blanchards thoughts, or perhaps as proof of his theory, Bitcoin adoption continues to grow as the assets price soars. At last look, 1 BTC is exchanging hands for 109,000.Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83  Investors like Bill OReilly and Rudy Giuliani areusing this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.Image: ShutterstockThis articleMIT Economist Rebuts Bitcoin Hype: No Imminent Threat To The Dollar As A Means Of Paymentoriginally appeared onBenzinga.comTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info\n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:46:04 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: macro\n                    '}

SHIB just closed a weekly candle at 0.00001334, positioning itself above a significant support level and setting the stage for a potential 20 surge if the momentum continues.AdvertisementThe setup is basic: The price is advancing toward the upper Bollinger Band on the weekly time frame, currently around 0.00001554.You Might Also LikeSun, 07132025 - 09:48120,000,000,000,000 Shiba Inu (SHIB): Whales Taking Full ControlByArman ShirinyanHOT StoriesBitcoin Rockets 1,724 in Abnormal Liquidation ImbalanceXRPs Massive Rally Driven Almost Entirely by Just One ExchangeBitcoin (BTC) to Hit 200,000? Elliott Wave Pattern Breakdown70,224,089 XRP Stuns Coinbase in Minutes, Whats Happening?This isnt the first time that SHIB has used this region as a launchpad. The 0.00001200 to 0.00001300 range has acted as a demand zone for months, with multiple successful retests since last year.AdvertisementThe difference now is the candle structure. Last weeks nearly 13 gain came from a clean bounce off the lower part of the range. This was followed by a close above the 20-week moving average for the first time in two months.Source:TradingViewThe Bollinger Bands are starting to open slightly, suggesting that volatility may be returning after a long period of sideways movement. If SHIB extends to the top band, which it tends to do once breakouts gain traction, the projected upside would put the token at around 0.00001550. That price is roughly 20 higher than the current price.You Might Also LikeSat, 07122025 - 20:00Mysterious SHIB Founder Ryoshis Message Suddenly Surfaces After 4 YearsByYuri MolchanThis would also putSHIB pricenear its April highs, where it previously struggled to maintain its position.However, the key now is that its reapproaching that level from a higher low with tighter consolidation and less overhead resistance in the mid-band area.

Local traders disproportionately accounted for roughly a third of XRPs spot trading volume.South Korean traders are famously keen on altcoin trading since crypto is seen as a shortcut to quick wealth. It is worth noting that the country has a rather strong culture of speculation that predates crypto, and younger investors are now chasing high-reward opportunities with riskier coins.Altcoins account for nearly 90 of trading volume on local exchanges, in sharp contrast to US-based trading platforms.XRPs rally stallsOn Friday, XRP spiked to nearly 3 on the Bitstamp exchange.

With the asset soaring toward 120,000 and sparking a potential target close to 200,000, Bitcoins price performance over the last few months has beenincredible.AdvertisementElliott Wave patterns usually consist of a three-wave corrective sequence after five impulsive waves (motive phase). According to Bitcoins daily chart, after consolidating around 65,000 the cryptocurrency seems to have finished a textbook motive phase that started in mid-April. Prices went from about 65,000 to 90,000 in the first impulsive wave and then there was a second corrective wave.BTCUSDT Chart by TradingViewThe third wave, which was probably the strongest leg of the impulse, sent Bitcoin into the six-figure range. With the recent breakout showing that the rally is intensifying on high volume, Bitcoin appears to be extending what may be wave five at this time. Volume spikes such as these usually validate Elliott Wave counts. They demonstrate how price is rising above resistance due to widespread participation, especially from institutional buyers.HOT StoriesBitcoin (BTC) to Hit 200,000?

Its still unclear if this wave pattern can push Bitcoin to 200,000. Technically,Bitcoinmay get close to that milestone if the fifth wave continues as it has in previous bull cycles, particularly in 2017 and 2021.In the past,Bitcoinhas had a tendency to rise significantly above previous all-time highs during blow-off tops. In this case, 140,000 to 200,000 is still a reasonable upward range if momentum continues. However, care must be taken. An impending corrective phase may be indicated by the RSI indicators entry into overbought territory. Any decline in momentum or a breach of the ascending support trendline are early indicators of a wave (2) correction that you might want to keep an eye out for.BitcoinAdvertisementRelated articlesNewsJul 13, 2025 - 10:13Bitcoin (BTC) up 3,900,000 Since First Ever TV MentionByTomiwabold OlajideNewsJul 13, 2025 - 9:48120,000,000,000,000 Shiba Inu (SHIB): Whales Taking Full ControlByArman ShirinyanPrev. articleNext article\n                    Source: utoday\n                    Published: Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:26:00 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    '}

However, this is going to change soon thanks to a wide integration of stablecoins, Ripple stresses.AdvertisementNow users, instead of using expensive and slow remittance services of Western Union or MoneyGram, can send remittances, say, from the U.S. to the Philippines by buying stablecoins, like USDT or Ripples RLUSD, and sending them via a cryptocurrency exchange or a digital wallet.You Might Also LikeFri, 07112025 - 20:21Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Says Hes a Fat Pig Sitting on BitcoinByAlex DovbnyaVisa giant embracing stablecoinsThe recipient will be able to spend those stablecoins, hold them, or exchange them into their local fiat currency.

Within days, Bitcoin broke through key resistance levels and soared above 117,000 with incredible speed. This move was vertical and backed by a noticeable increase in trading volume rather than merely a gradual ascent.In the past significant cyclical movements rather than brief rallies have begun when Bitcoin emerges from consolidation phases on soaring volume.

This rally is much more resilient than many previous upswings because it has been driven by steady accumulation rather than purely speculative leverage.

The most important signal for market participants is the volume spike that coincides with this breakout because it shows conviction and validates that demand is genuine and widespread.AdvertisementThis breakout might serve as the cornerstone of an upcoming long-term leg higher, propelling Bitcoin into uncharted territory, if history is any indication. Given the increasingly overbought conditions on daily time frames, short-term pullbacks are likely, but the bigger picture indicates that this move is just the beginning. While investors should expect increased volatility, it is also possible that as the bull cycle develops, Bitcoin is positioning itself for a surge toward 140,000 and higher.Shiba Inu finally aliveFollowing months of bearish and stagnant price action,Shiba Inuhas been blazing a much-needed recovery path. Now the meme coin is positioned to regain higher price levels not seen since the beginning of the year thanks to one of its best technical setups in recent memory. SHIB recently decisively broke above its 100-day and 50-day exponential moving averages, two important benchmarks that indicate growing bullish momentum.More significantly, this breakout is not occurring alone; it is occurring in tandem with an increase in on-chain activity, which includes a noticeable spike in the number and volume of large transactions, indicating that larger investors and whales are returning to the market.You Might Also LikeFri, 07112025 - 13:02Dogecoin to 1?

Technically, the next significant resistance level is located at or near 0.000015, which was a resolute ceiling prior to the market correction earlier this year. The current rally, in contrast to earlier attempts, is supported by increasing volume and broader market tailwinds such as Bitcoins breakout above 115,000 and improving sentiment across altcoins.The approaching overbought area on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) may signal a brief cooling-off, or if bullish momentum continues, additional acceleration. Since the daily chart shows no nearby resistance clusters,SHIBhas the space to continue pushing in the next few days or weeks toward the 0.000015 region.Ethereum makes itThe crucial 3,000 price mark  which many investors have been aiming for as the psychological entryway to a long-term market recovery  is finally within Ethereums reach.ETHhas recorded a robust run o\n                    Source: utoday\n                    Published: Sat, 12 Jul 2025 00:01:00 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    "}
