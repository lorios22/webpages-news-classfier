While it presents relevant information, the writing lacks clarity and organization, making it challenging for readers to follow the argument. Key technical terms like 'stablecoin' and 'CBDC' are not defined, which could confuse readers unfamiliar with these concepts. The content provides some actionable insights about the importance of regulatory clarity but fails to delve deeply into the implications of the proposed legislation or current market dynamics. Additionally, the article's structure is disorganized, with long paragraphs and no clear section headers, which detracts from reader engagement. Although the claims about the GENIUS Act are accurate, the unverified projection of the stablecoin market growth slightly undermines trustworthiness. Overall, the article has potential but requires significant improvements in clarity, depth, and organization to enhance reader understanding and engagement."

This bill does not have a counterpart in the Senate either.All three pieces of legislation are expected to pass the House with bipartisan support. That would be a big win for the industry. The bills arent flawless, Dowling said, but even an imperfect framework will dispel the current regulatory ambiguity and help crypto companies operate in the U.S. The rough spots will likely be smoothed out over time, she argued.Other countries are already in the race, while were still lacing up our shoes, she told CoinDesk.

(Jesse HamiltonCoinDesk)What to know:The tentative schedule for Crypto Week in the U.S. House of Representatives could see a Wednesday vote on the Clarity Act and a Thursday morning vote on the GENIUS Act, according to industry insiders tracking the action.The congressional action is expected to push crypto legislation to unprecedented heights in the U.S. as the industry finds greater traction with lawmakers.If the stablecoin rules in GENIUS pass, that bill could soon become the first major crypto law in the U.S.The U.S. House of Representatives so-called Crypto Week is steaming toward mid-week votes on two foundational pieces of legislation that would push the industrys status forward significantly in the U.S., including what amounts to a final congressional action on regulating stablecoins.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.While that last necessary vote on the stablecoin bill known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins(GENIUS)Act would send it to President Donald Trumps desk to be signed into law, its the bigger bill  the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act  that is the top concern of the crypto industry.That legislation to establish a regulatory framework for U.S. crypto activity is expected to come up late afternoon on Wednesday for its floor vote, industry lobbyists have been advised, which would send the Clarity Act over to the Senate for its consideration. The House has made it that far before on a market structure bill for digital assets, but the Senate was immobile on the issue during the previous congressional session. This time, key senators are making promises to complete work on this issue quickly.The Clarity Act is widely expected to pass with a heavy bipartisan vote. Its predecessor, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act(FIT21)drew 71 Democrats when it passed. Theres tremendous pressure on the sector and among the Republican lawmakers leading the charge to garner more than that for Clarity, so it arrives in the Senate with high momentum.While Senator Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has said the Clarity Act will act as a template for his chambers work, crypto lobbyists have been told that the lawmakers there may not hew closely to its language, suggesting a coming period of negotiation.On Thursday morning, according to people familiar with the planning, the House is tentatively expected to vote on GENIUS, the bill to set up guardrails for issuers of stablecoins, such as Circles USDC and Tethers USDT. That bill already passed the Senate with a wide bipartisan approval, and House lawmakers agreed to take it as-is, meaning its course would finish soon on Trumps desk if it clears this last legislative step.The series of votes amounts to the most consequential week yet for the digital asset industry on Capitol Hill, according to Blockchain Association Senior Director of Government Relations Jessica Martinez.Before all this vote timing can be set in stone, the House Rules Committee met on Monday afternoon to work out the plan. The Rules panel sets the procedures for how each piece of legislation will be handled on the House floor.Lawmakers from the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees defended the trio of bills before the Rules Committee in a lengthy hearing taht extended into Monday night. The House is set to vote after an hour of debate on each bill, though no amendments will be considered.If Crypto Week follows the expected course, itll end with a crypto milestone for Congress, passing the first-ever major crypto regulatory bill. Once GENIUS is law, the industry will focus full-time on market structure, though its unclear how much work will need to be done to reach agreement between the House and Senate. Senator Scott said the Senate will be done with its work by Sept. 30.Instead of taking up Clarity, we think the Senate will put forth its own bill, but not before September, said Ian Katz, a policy analyst at Capital Alpha, though he doubts the final effort will be completed this year.Also this week, the House was prepared to pass another bill that would ban a U.S. central bank digital currency(CBDC). Republican lawmakers have made the case against the Federal Reserve issuing a digital dollar that they",

If the stablecoin rules in GENIUS pass, that bill could soon become the first major crypto law in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives so-called Crypto Week is steaming toward mid-week votes on two foundational pieces of legislation that would push the industry's status forward significantly in the U.S., including what amounts to a final congressional action on regulating stablecoins.\n\nWhile that last necessary vote on the stablecoin bill known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act would send it to President Donald Trump's desk to be signed into law, it's the bigger bill—the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act—that is the top concern of the crypto industry.\n\nThat legislation to establish a regulatory framework for U.S. crypto activity is expected to come up late afternoon on Wednesday for its floor vote, industry lobbyists have been advised, which would send the Clarity Act over to the Senate for its consideration. The House has made it that far before on a market structure bill for digital assets, but the Senate was immobile on the issue during the previous congressional session. This time, key senators are making promises to complete work on this issue quickly.\n\nThe Clarity Act is widely expected to pass with a heavy bipartisan vote. Its predecessor, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) drew 71 Democrats when it passed. There's tremendous pressure on the sector and among the Republican lawmakers leading the charge to garner more than that for Clarity, so it arrives in the Senate with high momentum.\n\nWhile Senator Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has said the Clarity Act will act as a template for his chamber's work, crypto lobbyists have been told that the lawmakers there may not hew closely to its language, suggesting a coming period of negotiation.\n\nOn Thursday morning, according to people familiar with the planning, the House is tentatively expected to vote on GENIUS, the bill to set up guardrails for issuers of stablecoins, such as Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT. That bill already passed the Senate with wide bipartisan approval, and House lawmakers agreed to take it as-is, meaning its course would finish soon on Trump's desk if it clears this last legislative step.\n\nThe series of votes amounts to the most consequential week yet for the digital asset industry on Capitol Hill, according to Blockchain Association Senior Director of Government Relations Jessica Martinez.\n\nBefore all this vote timing can be set in stone, the House Rules Committee met on Monday afternoon to work out the plan. The Rules panel sets the procedures for how each piece of legislation will be handled on the House floor. Lawmakers from the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees defended the trio of bills before the Rules Committee in a lengthy hearing that extended into Monday night. The House is set to vote after an hour of debate on each bill, though no amendments will be considered.\n\nIf Crypto Week follows the expected course, it'll end with a crypto milestone for Congress, passing the first-ever major crypto regulatory bill. Once GENIUS is law, the industry will focus full-time on market structure, though it's unclear how much work will need to be done to reach agreement between the House and Senate. Senator Scott said the Senate will be done with its work by September 30.\n\nInstead of taking up Clarity, we think the Senate will put forth its own bill, but not before September, said Ian Katz, a policy analyst at Capital Alpha, though he doubts the final effort will be completed this year.\n\nAlso this week, the House was prepared to pass another bill that would ban a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). Republican lawmakers have made the case against the Federal Reserve issuing a digital dollar.",

Yet these revolutions have largely failed to materialize.The issue isnt technology. Its that weve been building solutions looking for problems, rather than focusing on solving real challenges and delivering real value.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Most projects create tokens first, utility later. This speculation cycle has consumed the industry, measuring success by token price, not actual value creation. Were missing the crucial ingredient: a mechanism that rewards building useful things rather than building over-hyped useless things.What if there was a protocol that flipped this model and projects had to create value first, then get rewarded? Thats Bittensor.Bittensor: Rewarding Performance Over MindshareIn some waysBittensoris like the Y Combinator of AI. Whereas Y Combinator gives startups money and mentorship in exchange for equity, Bittensor gives builders incentives through token emissions, measures performance through free market dynamics, and rewards winners without human gatekeepers.Think of it as an economic game where independent teams compete to build valuable AI services. Every 12 seconds, the network distributes rewards based purely on usefulness. No marketing budgets. No insiders. No traditional fundraising. No KOLs. Just performance.The tokenomics are elegant yet powerful. Like Bitcoin, Bittensors native TAO has a fixed supply cap of 21 million, with 7,200 tokens distributed daily and supply halving every four years. This creates genuine scarcity in the form of rewards that must be earned through performance rather than speculation.Heres where it gets even more interesting: each subnet has its own alpha token that subnet participants earn. TAO holders can stake into subnets they believe in, receiving that subnets alpha tokens in return. Higher-performing subnets attract more TAO stake and get a larger share of daily emissions. This market-driven funding mechanism means that builders get paid only if their service actually works and successful projects automatically get more resources, while also rewarding those who staked.These performance-based rewards mean that anyone can build but the market decides the winner.

          "cleaned_content": "Why Bittensor Is AI’s Best Next-Gen Incubator\n\nWith competing AI projects and performance-based rewards, Bittensor represents a shift from speculation-driven to utility-driven tokenomics, says Arrash Yasavolian, Founder and CEO, Taoshi (Subnet 8 on Bittensor).\n\nAfter nearly ten years in crypto, I've watched hundreds of projects promise to revolutionize everything from banking to art. Yet these revolutions have largely failed to materialize. The issue isn't technology. It's that we've been building solutions looking for problems, rather than focusing on solving real challenges and delivering real value.\n\nMost projects create tokens first, utility later. This speculation cycle has consumed the industry, measuring success by token price, not actual value creation. We're missing the crucial ingredient: a mechanism that rewards building useful things rather than building over-hyped useless things.\n\nWhat if there was a protocol that flipped this model and projects had to create value first, then get rewarded? That's Bittensor.\n\nBittensor: Rewarding Performance Over Mindshare\n\nIn some ways Bittensor is like the Y Combinator of AI. Whereas Y Combinator gives startups money and mentorship in exchange for equity, Bittensor gives builders incentives through token emissions, measures performance through free market dynamics, and rewards winners without human gatekeepers. Think of it as an economic game where independent teams compete to build valuable AI services. Every 12 seconds, the network distributes rewards based purely on usefulness. No marketing budgets. No insiders. No traditional fundraising. No KOLs. Just performance.\n\nThe tokenomics are elegant yet powerful. Like Bitcoin, Bittensor's native TAO has a fixed supply cap of 21 million, with 7,200 tokens distributed daily and supply halving every four years. This creates genuine scarcity in the form of rewards that must be earned through performance rather than speculation.\n\nHere's where it gets even more interesting: each subnet has its own alpha token that subnet participants earn. TAO holders can stake into subnets they believe in, receiving that subnet's alpha tokens in return. Higher-performing subnets attract more TAO stake and get a larger share of daily emissions. This market-driven funding mechanism means that builders get paid only if their service actually works and successful projects automatically get more resources, while also rewarding those who staked.\n\nThese performance-based rewards mean that anyone can build but the market decides the winner. And, since it's open-source software, if a project isn't delivering, others create a better version. This makes Bittensor a transparent competition where all metrics are public. It's been called capitalistic Darwinism. In other words, create value or get out-competed.\n\nWhy Bittensor Changes Everything\n\nBig Tech's grip on AI is only getting stronger. Bittensor represents our best chance at wresting control and anchoring innovation in an open, transparent, and democratic environment where value accrues to the most performant innovations, rather than closed systems that benefit from outsized network effects.\n\nFor the public, Bittensor represents crypto's original promise: coordinating human effort toward valuable outcomes without intermediaries, committees, or gatekeepers.

Crypto Rallies as Pressure Mounts on Chairman Jerome PowellThe White Houses campaign for new Federal Reserve leadership amped higher over the weekend.ByStephen Alpher,Helene BraunEdited byStephen AlpherJul 14, 2025, 2:22 p.m.Pressure rises on Fed Chair Jerome Powell (Federal Reserve, modified by CoinDesk)What to know:The Trump administration has been targeting questions about the Feds 2.5 billion renovation project as a way to put more pressure on Chairman Powell to step down or as cause for his firing.Two supposed contenders for Powells replacement slammed the Fed leader over the weekend.A new Fed chair to be appointed by President Trump would surely be supportive of the White Houses continued calls for sharply lower interest rates.All things being equal, easier monetary policy tends to be good for risk assets  crypto surely among them. Bitcoin rallied to above 120,000 for the first time ever over the weekend as pressure on hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to step down or be fired amped even higher. Coincidence?To review, Jerome Powell  who rushed through 75 basis points of rate cuts prior to the 2024 election  quickly switched to a more hawkish stance following Donald Trumps election(though he did allow one more 25 basis point cut just after November), and it famously hasnt sat well with the president.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Frankly, its about breaking some heads,said former Fed Governor Kevin Warshon Fox News on Sunday. Warsh, who has been consistently touted as a leading possible replacement for Powell, added that the central banks 2.5 billion renovation project was among several examples of how the Fed has lost its way and said it was time for regime change.Also appearing on TV on Sunday and also another contender to lead a post-Powell Fed, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hasset said the presidents possible power to fire Jerome Powell is being looked into ... but certainly if theres cause, he does.The latest angle of attack against Powell is the Feds 2.5 billion renovation project. Powell is being questioned not just over the massive expense, but over whether he may have misled Congress in his testimony regarding the renovation. Office of Management and Budget(OMB)Director Russ Vought last week sent Powell a list of questions regarding the project.The Fed over the weekend created a newFAQ page on its websiteto give its side of the story.Trump doesnt ease upAdding his comments over the weekend, the president said it would be a great thing for the country if Powell were to exit.Jerome Powell has been very bad for our country, he added. We should have the lowest interest rate on Earth, and we dont. He just refuses to do it.I dont know what he knows about building, but you talk about cost overrun, Trump said of the 2.5 billion renovation. He reminded that the project was approved and began moving forward while Joe Biden was still president.Regulatory angle as wellWhile Powell has kept a publicly neutral stance towards crypto, a new Fed chair could be seen as a positive for the community even beyond what surely would be easier monetary policy.Powell, over the years, has maintained his stance that bitcoin is a competitor to gold rather than to the U.S. dollar given that people are not using it as a form of payment but rather as an investment vehicle.However, he has repeatedly called for clearer regulation, specifically around stablecoins and their risks to financial stability as the industry continued to grow more mainstream. He has also stressed the importance of consumer protections as well as concerns about debanking practices in which financial institutions are forced to cut ties with crypto firms due to the risks associated with the asset class.Federal ReserveBitcoinStephen AlpherStephen is CoinDesks managing editor for Markets.

Thats why Im concerned that too many Democrats are standing on the sidelines or standing in the way of one of the most transformative financial innovations of our time: blockchain and cryptocurrency.Blockchain and crypto are already driving job creation across the country, from data centers and fintech startups to cybersecurity firms and developers working on decentralized infrastructure. This technology means more jobs, higher wages, and more money in peoples pockets, especially in communities that have been left behind by the traditional financial system.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.The numbers dont lie. Voters overwhelmingly support integrating crypto into the American financial system. More thantwo-thirds of Americans believethere should be clearer rules and regulations for the crypto industry, rather than leaving it largely unregulated, according to multiple industry-leading public opinion polls.Andtwo-thirds believethe current global financial system favors powerful interests and not them. Democrats need to understand that voters want an alternative to the current financial system that provides them with the economic freedom that is so desperately needed. That is a winning middle class message.These numbers reflect a clear mandate for action. Yet our partys leadership has often approached crypto with skepticism or outright hostility, creating a partisan divide on an innovation that should transcend political boundaries.This misalignment became painfully evident during recent elections, with Republicans, including Donald Trump, having embraced crypto, while Democrats appeared out of touch with the technological revolution reshaping our economy. We cannot afford to cede this ground, especially when crypto and blockchain offer solutions to many of the economic challenges weve long sought to address.The Democratic Party has always stood for expanding economic opportunity and ensuring that working people arent taken advantage of by powerful financial institutions. As a lifelong entrepreneur and Virginias former governor, Ive seen how embracing innovation can open doors for workers, businesses, and families across every corner of our economy. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are no exceptionthey offer real tools to increase financial inclusion, expand access, and create good-paying jobs.This isnt just theory, it is what voters are telling us. Communities of color and younger Americans, especially young men, see real promise in crypto as a path to economic empowerment. These are core Democratic constituencies, and theyll be essential to winning back the map in 2028 and beyond. If we want to remain the party of opportunity, we have to lead the way on forward-looking regulationnot stand in the way of progress.Innovation in crypto means financial services for communities traditionally underserved by conventional banking systems, offering faster, cheaper transactions and broader access to capital. For minority communities, in particular, who have historically faced discrimination in traditional banking, crypto represents a path to financial empowerment through self-custody and consumer choice.

Crypto will create a system of payment that benefits consumers and small businesses everywhere.Now, we have a crucial opportunity to correct our course.

This legislation offers a balanced approach that both nurtures innovation, strengthens the U.S. dollar and establishes necessary guardrails.The GENIUS Acts provisions will streamline our financial system and eliminate costly fees that disproportionately affect small businesses and low-income Americans.

Its a common tactic for gauging regulatory feedback while keeping competitive details out of public view until a launch is ready.The move adds Grayscale to the number of growing companies lining up to take their companies public as the digital assets market heats up, with bitcoinBTC118,521.37hitting new all-time highs.Stablecoin issuer Circle(CRCL)made its public debutat the beginning of June, and the stock has surged more than 500 since then. A few weeks prior to that, stock-trading app eToro(ETOR)also made the move. Its shares are now 10 higher.While Circle and eToro hit the market during challenging macroeconomic times due to tariff discussions led by President Donald Trump, both debuted at higher valuations than anticipated, suggesting renewed interest in digital assets as U.S. legislators inch closer to clearer rules for crypto companies, especially stablecoin issuers.Grayscales proposal, in contrast, comes at a time of bullish momentum for crypto assets. The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is hitting record highs on an almost daily basis. The token is currently trading at 121,728, up 30 year-to-date, and justovertook goldas the years best-performing asset.Grayscale is one of the largest crypto asset managers. Its core products are trusts and exchange-traded funds(ETFs)such as its flagship Graysale Bitcoin Trust(GBTC)and Ethereum Trust(ETHE), both of which converted into ETFs in January last year. The two alone have a combined 24 billion of assets under management.Both have suffered heavy outflows since their conversion because the asset manager charges a higher fee for its products than competitors, making it more expensive for investors to buy and hold the product.Many, however, believe that Grayscale is one of the reasons why the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved to begin with after itwon a legal fightagainst SEC over its spot bitcoin ETF application, ultimately leading to the approval of several bitcoin ETFs.UPDATE(July 14, 13:25 UTC):Changes lead photo.UPDATE(July 14, 13:48 UTC):Adds recent IPOs in fifth paragraph, Grayscale products, background starting in eighth.FastNewsIPOBreaking NewsGrayscaleAoyon AshrafAoyon Ashraf is CoinDesks Head of Americas.

The asset manager did not disclose details of the submission, which will proceed after the SEC's review and market conditions.\n\nConfidential filings allow companies to negotiate with the SEC privately, a strategy used to keep competitive details under wraps until a public launch is ready.\n\nGrayscale Investments said it confidentially submitted a draft S-1 registration statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a filing that signals plans for an initial public offering (IPO). The asset manager owned by Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group didn't disclose details of the submission and said the registration is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions, according to a press release.\n\nConfidential filings allow firms to negotiate with the agency behind closed doors before revealing their plans. It's a common tactic for gauging regulatory feedback while keeping competitive details out of public view until a launch is ready.\n\nThe move adds Grayscale to the number of growing companies lining up to take their companies public as the digital assets market heats up, with bitcoin hitting new all-time highs. Stablecoin issuer Circle made its public debut at the beginning of June, and the stock has surged more than 500% since then. A few weeks prior to that, stock-trading app eToro also made the move. Its shares are now 10% higher.\n\nWhile Circle and eToro hit the market during challenging macroeconomic times due to tariff discussions led by President Donald Trump, both debuted at higher valuations than anticipated, suggesting renewed interest in digital assets as U.S. legislators inch closer to clearer rules for crypto companies, especially stablecoin issuers.\n\nGrayscale's proposal, in contrast, comes at a time of bullish momentum for crypto assets. The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is hitting record highs on an almost daily basis. The token is currently trading at 121,728, up 30% year-to-date, and just overtook gold as the year's best-performing asset.\n\nGrayscale is one of the largest crypto asset managers. Its core products are trusts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Ethereum Trust (ETHE), both of which converted into ETFs in January last year. The two alone have a combined 24 billion of assets under management.\n\nBoth have suffered heavy outflows since their conversion because the asset manager charges a higher fee for its products than competitors, making it more expensive for investors to buy and hold the product. Many, however, believe that Grayscale is one of the reasons why the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved to begin with after it won a legal fight against SEC over its spot bitcoin ETF application, ultimately leading to the approval of several bitcoin ETFs.",

Tornado Cash Dev Roman Storms Money Laundering Trial Kicks Off MondayIf convicted on all three charges, Storm faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison.ByCheyenne LigonEdited byNikhilesh DeJul 14, 2025, 1:05 p.m.NEW YORK, New York  Tornado Cash developer Roman Storms criminal money laundering is slated to begin in Manhattan on Monday morning, when Storms lawyers and prosecutors will begin to select a jury to oversee Storms four-week trial.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Storm was arrested in Washington state in 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business  charges which, if Storm is convicted, carry a maximum combined sentence of 45 years in prison. Storms fellow Tornado Cash developer, Russian national Roman Semenov, faces the same charges but remains at large. Another developer, Alexey Pertsev, wasconvicted of money launderingin the Netherlands in 2024 and sentenced to five years in prison, which he iscurrently appealing.At the heart of Storms case lies Tornado Cash, a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency mixing service, which the government has alleged was used to launder over 1 billion in criminal proceeds by bad actors  including the Lazarus Group, North Koreas state-sanctioned hacking operation, which they say constituted a violation of U.S. sanctions  while Storm and his colleagues turned a blind eye. Storms lawyers, meanwhile, haveargued that he was simply a developer of open-source, decentralized softwarewith legitimate, privacy-preserving uses who should not be held responsible for bad actors use of it.Theres certainly going to be a very vigorous defense here that they were writing code and that Tornado Cash was designed for privacy  that some people may have taken advantage of it, but Storm and his colleagues werent co-conspirators, said Mark Bini, a partner in Reed Smiths global regulatory and enforcement practice group. Mixers have been very controversial because theyve been used by lots of people doing bad things, no doubt about it, but the idea that some people would want to use them for privacy, thats a legitimate argument as well. Thats going to make for a fierce battle here.Storms trial has drawn the attention of many in the crypto industry, who haveraised concernsthat, if Storm is found guilty, it could mean that developers down the line areon the hookfor how people use their programs  something that could have devastating consequences for both the availability of privacy tools and the decentralized finance(DeFi)space as a whole. A host of major players in the industry, including investment firm Paradigm, and non-profit advocacy groups Coin Center and the DeFi Education Fund, have submitted amicus briefs in Storms defense.Others, however, have been more reluctant to accept Storms privacy defense. Economics writer J.P. Koenig wrote ina 2024 blog postthat, if Storm prevails at trial, it could potentially mean that anyone who wants to facilitate illegal activities would have a strong incentive to copy Tornado Cash, effectively turning their operation into a golem  a deathless artificial being run on smart contracts  and then throwing away the keys to avoid the law.Swiss blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger wrote ina blog postthat there are, in general, far more reasons why cyber criminals might want to use a mixing service than developers who legitimately want to obfuscate the movement of their personal funds.Shifting windsStorms trial begins as the U.S. government continues to overhaul its approach to the crypto industry  particuarly crypto regulation.

          "cleaned_content": "Right to Code? Tornado Cash Dev Roman Storm's Money Laundering Trial Kicks Off Monday\n\nIf convicted on all three charges, Storm faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison.\n\nNEW YORK, New York — Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm's criminal money laundering trial is slated to begin in Manhattan on Monday morning, when Storm's lawyers and prosecutors will begin to select a jury to oversee Storm's four-week trial.\n\nStorm was arrested in Washington state in 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business — charges which, if Storm is convicted, carry a maximum combined sentence of 45 years in prison. Storm's fellow Tornado Cash developer, Russian national Roman Semenov, faces the same charges but remains at large. Another developer, Alexey Pertsev, was convicted of money laundering in the Netherlands in 2024 and sentenced to five years in prison, which he is currently appealing.\n\nAt the heart of Storm's case lies Tornado Cash, a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency mixing service, which the government has alleged was used to launder over $1 billion in criminal proceeds by bad actors including the Lazarus Group, North Korea's state-sanctioned hacking operation, which they say constituted a violation of U.S. sanctions while Storm and his colleagues turned a blind eye. Storm's lawyers, meanwhile, have argued that he was simply a developer of open-source, decentralized software with legitimate, privacy-preserving uses who should not be held responsible for bad actors' use of it.\n\n\"There's certainly going to be a very vigorous defense here that they were writing code and that Tornado Cash was designed for privacy — that some people may have taken advantage of it, but Storm and his colleagues weren't co-conspirators,\" said Mark Bini, a partner in Reed Smith's global regulatory and enforcement practice group. \"Mixers have been very controversial because they've been used by lots of people doing bad things, no doubt about it, but the idea that some people would want to use them for privacy, that's a legitimate argument as well. That's going to make for a fierce battle here.\"\n\nStorm's trial has drawn the attention of many in the crypto industry, who have raised concerns that, if Storm is found guilty, it could mean that developers down the line are on the hook for how people use their programs — something that could have devastating consequences for both the availability of privacy tools and the decentralized finance (DeFi) space as a whole. A host of major players in the industry, including investment firm Paradigm, and non-profit advocacy groups Coin Center and the DeFi Education Fund, have submitted amicus briefs in Storm's defense.\n\nOthers, however, have been more reluctant to accept Storm's privacy defense. Economics writer J.P. Koenig wrote in a 2024 blog post that, if Storm prevails at trial, it could potentially mean that anyone who wants to facilitate illegal activities would have a strong incentive to copy Tornado Cash, effectively turning their operation into a golem — a deathless artificial being run on smart contracts — and then throwing away the keys to avoid the law. Swiss blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger wrote in a blog post that there are, in general, far more reasons why cyber criminals might want to use a mixing service than developers who legitimately want to obfuscate the movement of their personal funds.\n\nShifting winds\n\nStorm's trial begins as the U.S. government continues to overhaul its approach to the crypto industry, particularly crypto regulation. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the White House has taken a friendlier stance towards the industry (which poured a whopping $130 million into congressional races in the 2024 elections and at least $18 million into Trump's inaugural committee alone), nudging regulators and law enforcement to do the same.

It is also one of the best performing in emerging markets.Mexicos high interest rates and President Claudia Sheinbaums tempered approach toward Trump have helped lure in cash from investors reallocating money away from the US. And after months of repeated delays on the implementation of tariffs, money managers have grown more complacent, with reactions to fresh announcements largely contained as they look past Trumps threats to focus on the medium-term outlook.Markets know the drill, said Marco Oviedo, a senior strategist at XP Investimentos in Sao Paulo. The only risk that I see is if the Mexican government fails to deliver something that Trump wants on drug control that might leave tariffs high for longer or negotiations in limbo.Mexicos strong economic ties to the US have also worked in the pesos favor. The US doesnt intend to apply the 30 rate to USMCA-compliant goods, a White House official said on Saturday. The administration has previously said it will keep the exemption for Canada.Although Mexican officials were taken aback by Trumps latest tariff threat, US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said Saturday in Mexico City that Sheinbaum and Trump have a wonderful relationship and no partnership should be easier than between their two countries.Sheinbaum said Monday during her daily press conference that her government expects to reach a tariff deal with the US before an Aug. 1 deadline and has a plan if talks fail. Shes expected to meet later today with a Mexican trade negotiating team that was in Washington on Friday discussing the issue.The countrys rate differentials are another factor helping prop up the currency. The central bank has been cautious when lowering interest rates, keeping the peso on the radar of carry traders who borrow in lower-yielding currencies to buy those that offer higher yields. One-week implied volatility in the peso, which spiked amid US elections last year and again in April amid tariff threats, has remained largely subdued.After delivering a half-point cut that left the key rate at 8 last month, Governor Victoria Rodriguez embraced the likelihood of smaller reductions going forward in a July 9 speech. That helped the peso inch higher last week, outperforming as developing-world currencies slipped amid the latest barrage of tariff announcements.Story ContinuesThe rally in Mexico has gone beyond the currency. Local bonds and stocks have also gained in the wake of Trumps so-called Liberation Day on April 2 amid a positive backdrop for emerging markets as the dollar slips.The peso is trading incredibly well in the face of this, said Eric Fine, portfolio manager for emerging markets debt at Van Eck Associates. This reaction has many explanations, but EMFX and interest rates have had a great year despite tariff-dominated news flow.What Bloomberg strategists say:The proposal lacks clarity, particularly whether it replaces or supplements the existing 25 fentanyl-related levy, and does not address the treatment of USMCA-compliant goods. This omission is notable given that, as of May, approximately 83 of US imports from Mexico were exempt from tariffs due to USMCA provisions.
