President Donald Trump fulfilled part of his vow to establish U.S. crypto regulations on Friday, signing legislation into law that formally established rules for stablecoin issuers  marking a first step that the digital assets industry hopes will end with the more important regulatory regime governing the wider crypto markets.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Before a crowd of crypto executives in the East Room of the White House, a jubilant Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins(GENIUS)Act, which registered amassive 308-122 bipartisan vote in the House of Representativeson Thursday and an earlier 68-30 vote in the Senate  demonstrating a huge margin of support from Democrats.Trump walked into a packed East Room filled with applauding lawmakers and industry leaders, including Coinbases Brian Armstrong, Tethers Paolo Ardoino, Circles Jeremy Allaire, Geminis Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Krakens Dave Ripley andSo congratulations, youve come a long way since the Biden administration, when they had no idea what you were all talking about, and half of you are under arrest, he joked at the outset.Trump called out various members of Congress by name, alongside members of his Cabinet, saying they were instrumental in moving the legislation, as well as various industry leaders attending the ceremony.Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out, he said. You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago, but this signing is a massive validation.The GENIUS Act will now be forwarded to the federal financial and banking agencies that must implement its various provisions. That will include formalizing the definitions for what kind of firms make acceptable issuers of stablecoins, which is a field currently dominated by Tethers USDT and Circles USDC, though Wall Street institutions have been jumping into the space at a rapid pace.Implementation of a law by federal regulators can be a drawn-out process, but GENIUS at least gives the industry a broad roadmap for how its U.S. interactions will look in the future. So pressure now shifts from lobbying to execution for stablecoin companies.The act sets a necessarily compliance baseline, but whether stablecoins can deliver their promise will depend on how effectively stablecoin issuers disclose reserves, implement operational safeguards, maintain robust governance practices and ensure structural alignment between issuers interests and consumer protection, noted Rajeev Bamra, an associate managing director for digital economy at Moodys Ratings, in a statement. With broader adoption comes greater systemic responsibility of market participants.The industry has come a long way in Washington since its tumultuous 2022 in which several major businesses failed spectacularly, and crypto-supporting lawmakers were burned by the fall of global exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was a fixture in congressional meetings and the industrys D.C. events. But aggressive lobbying and a major campaign-finance push from the industrys Fairshake political action committee during last years congressional elections elevated the sector into the good graces of the White House and Congress.Trump has declared himself the crypto president, and his administration has routinely called fora golden age for the industryto begin. Now that GENIUS is law, the focus shifts toward the bigger task of passing legislation that defines the proper oversight of different forms of cryptocurrency, trading platforms and projects and assigns federal agencies to new roles as watchdogs over these markets.White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks took the podium briefly to praise Trump and the legislation, saying that while hes used to the tech world moving quickly, the speed at which GENIUS became law this was fast for us in Silicon Valley.This GENIUS Act will unlock American dominance in the crypto industry by creating clear rules of the road, he said. It will update archaic payment rails with a revolutionary new payment system, and it will extend U.S. dollar dominance, like Trump said, globally by creating a digital dollar that people all over the world can use. And for every digital dollar in a crypto wallet,",

The historical score is relatively strong, suggesting that the article aligns well with ongoing trends in crypto regulation. Overall, while the article is relevant and addresses a significant legislative action, it requires improvements in clarity, depth, and structure to enhance its overall effectiveness."

What Does It Mean for Crypto?As Crypto Week comes to an end, here is why the GENIUS bill, which will establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S., matters for crypto and the masses.ByNikhilesh De,Aoyon AshrafEdited byAoyon AshrafUpdatedJul 18, 2025, 4:46 p.m.PublishedJul 18, 2025, 4:38 p.m.What to know:The GENIUS Act, which President Trump is expected to sign into law, establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S.The law assigns oversight of stablecoin issuers to the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.The bill aims to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins, potentially making them more mainstream and fostering financial innovation.The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, otherwise known as GENIUS, will become law later this Friday when U.S. President Donald Trump signs the first major piece of legislation addressing digital assets.This is a historic law for the digital assets industry, which has been craving for regulatory clarity for years. But what is it?STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.The GENIUS bill, which started in the Senate, sets up a regulatory framework to address stablecoins, cryptocurrencies whose values are pegged to the value of another asset  usually the U.S. dollar.The U.S. dollar stablecoin industry, with a267 billion market capitalization, is largely dominated by Tether and Circle(CRCL)and primarily used as an intermediate asset for trading or a tool for accessing the U.S. dollar in countries with hyperinflation or other monetary issues.The GENIUS Actcreates a definition for payment through stablecoins. The law assigns the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  two of the major U.S. bank regulators  tasks overseeing their issuance. The Fed will be tasked with the big bank issuers, while the OCC will oversee nonbank issuers with more than 10 billion in stablecoins. State regulators can still oversee certain issuers above the 10 billion threshold if they meet certain criteria and can secure a waiver.The bill also definesreserve requirements and creates requirements for issuers to regularly share information about their reserves. The reserves themselves must be in U.S. currency, demand deposits, Treasurys and other approved assets.Why does it matter?Essentially, this law will translate into potentially clear regulatory frameworks for using stablecoins for everyday financial transactions, which is good news for crypto companies and consumers, according to some observers.This bill will empower American businesses and consumers and enable them to take advantage of the next iteration of financial innovation, said Kirsten Gillibrand, a longtime Democrat sponsor of stablecoin legislation.This could also help crypto become more mainstream for the masses, help accelerate further innovation in the financial system, leveraging the blockchain technology.This new stablecoin law will help unlock technologies that will transform how value moves around the world, expand access to the financial system, and unlock new economic opportunities for millions. Were just scratching the surface of whats possible, said Avery Ching, CEO and co-founder of Aptos Labs.Another part of the bill that might help legitimize the digital assets revolution is that it treats stablecoin issuers as financial institutions as far as anti-money laundering rules go, putting in place requirements on what sort of customer data these companies need to collect and verify.Which lines up with the efforts from some of the crypto firms hoping to become a bank. For example, recently, Circle(CRCL), the company behind the USDC stablecoin,said it has filedan application with the OCC to form a federally regulated national trust bank. Such a charter would bring Circle under direct OCC oversight, aligning it with how traditional financial institutions are regulated.Although the bill has been applauded by pro-crypto parties and firms, some Democratshave issued warningsthat the bill does not go far enough to protect consumers or block public officials from benefiting from their crypto activities, pointing to the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial and its USD1 stablecoin.However, while Democrats did force a slowdown in work on GENIUS on the Senate floor earlier this year, they ultimately voted for the billafter some changes. The bill saw massive bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.Read more:Crypto Week Reaction: What GENIUS and CLARITY Bills Mean for the IndustryAnalysisStablecoinTrumpNikhilesh DeNikhilesh De is CoinDesks managing editor for global policy and regulation, covering regula",

The source, CoinDesk, is credible and well-regarded in the crypto industry. The immediate market reaction, with a stock price increase, indicates some short-term impact. However, the long-term implications of such treasury strategies could influence institutional investment trends in Ethereum, making it highly relevant for stakeholders like traders and institutions. The analysis is somewhat detailed, providing context on the company's strategy shift, which adds depth to the impact assessment."

After bitcoinBTC118,738.05broke record highs last week and consolidated this week, the way opened for capital to rotate into the more speculative altcoin market.Fridays top performers are known as dinosaur coins, many of which were created before the 2017 bull market.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Ethereum classicETC19.84leads the pack with a 24-hour surge of 20 after breaking through the 20.27 level of resistance. It still faces a stern test at 25.00, a level it rejected exactly one year ago before plummeting to 15.80.ETCUSD (TradingView)ETCs growing popularity is reflected in its trading volume. That tripled to 756 million, showing the move is backed by traders who are rolling capital from sector to sector in true altcoin season style.LitecoinLTC101.27, bitcoin cashBCH496.06, dogecoinDOGE0.2136and of course XRP also posted notable gains. And all rose to stardom as retail investors poured capital into the 2017 cycle.LTC is up in part because ofMEI Pharmas 100 million LTC fundwith the projects founder, Charlie Lee, taking a board seat. But its also due to a general rotation into legacy coins that stuttered duringthis weeks ferocious altcoin move.UniswapUNI8.9695, which was actually released slightly later than the others, in 2020, also climbed 20, and as volume topped 1.7 billion  a 70 increase.It is now trading above the 8.11 and 10.33 levels of resistance as it looks to move up towards 12.09, a level that caused several rejections during the middle of last year.UNIUSD (TradingView)What does Fridays move mean?The rotation into dinosaur coins can be looked at one of two ways. Either it is a bullish scenario in which traders are flipping their gains and moving methodically from sector to sector, or it is the early etchings of a cycle high, with traders attempting to squeeze the final scraps of profit before a the market enters a correction.There are several technical indicators that first, bullish, scenario is the most likely, including a series of breakouts above months-old levels of resistance. If, however, bitcoin tumbles below 110,000 altcoins will suffer a complete wipeout.Open interest on several altcoins suggests the recent move has been backed with leverage. Dogecoin open interest is up at 2 billion, a 30 rise in 24 hours, while uniswaps is up by 35 to 389 million,Coinalyze data shows.Altcoin open interest increasing (Coinalyze)This means that if the market experiences a broader sell-off, leveraged altcoin positions will unwind, leading to liquidations and subsequent pressure to sell. Coupled with the reduced liquidity and lower market depth of altcoins, several tokens could face a decline in excess of 10.The ideal scenario for altcoins is bitcoin climbing above the 124,000, a level of resistance, and moving higher before another period of consolidation. That would allow capital to rotate without the risk of an immediate correction.altcoinLitecoinEthereum ClassicBull MarketOliver KnightOliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team.

          "cleaned_content": "Markets\n\nEthereum Classic leads Friday's rally with a 20% breakout, as legacy altcoins surge on rising volume and leverage, but Bitcoin's next move will determine if the momentum lasts.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) surged 20%, leading legacy coins like Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP (XRP), driven by capital rotation after Bitcoin hit record highs. Trading in ETC volume spiked 212% to 756 million, while open interest in DOGE and UNI rose sharply, suggesting heightened speculative trading. A BTC breakout above 124,000 could sustain altcoin momentum, while a drop below 110,000 risks triggering leveraged liquidations and widespread sell-offs.\n\nThe highly-anticipated altcoin season is finally here. After Bitcoin broke record highs last week and consolidated this week, the way opened for capital to rotate into the more speculative altcoin market. Friday's top performers are known as dinosaur coins, many of which were created before the 2017 bull market.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) leads the pack with a 24-hour surge of 20% after breaking through the 20.27 level of resistance. It still faces a stern test at 25.00, a level it rejected exactly one year ago before plummeting to 15.80.\n\nETC's growing popularity is reflected in its trading volume. That tripled to 756 million, showing the move is backed by traders who are rolling capital from sector to sector in true altcoin season style. Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and of course XRP also posted notable gains. And all rose to stardom as retail investors poured capital into the 2017 cycle.\n\nLTC is up in part because of MEI Pharma's 100 million LTC fund with the project's founder, Charlie Lee, taking a board seat. But it's also due to a general rotation into legacy coins that stuttered during this week's ferocious altcoin move. Uniswap (UNI), which was actually released slightly later than the others, in 2020, also climbed 20%, and as volume topped 1.7 billion - a 70% increase. It is now trading above the 8.11 and 10.33 levels of resistance as it looks to move up towards 12.09, a level that caused several rejections during the middle of last year.\n\nWhat does Friday's move mean? The rotation into dinosaur coins can be looked at one of two ways. Either it is a bullish scenario in which traders are flipping their gains and moving methodically from sector to sector, or it is the early etchings of a cycle high, with traders attempting to squeeze the final scraps of profit before the market enters a correction. There are several technical indicators that first, bullish, scenario is the most likely, including a series of breakouts above months-old levels of resistance. If, however, Bitcoin tumbles below 110,000, altcoins will suffer a complete wipeout.\n\nOpen interest on several altcoins suggests the recent move has been backed with leverage. Dogecoin open interest is up at 2 billion, a 30% rise in 24 hours, while Uniswap's is up by 35% to 389 million, Coinalyze data shows.\n\nThis means that if the market experiences a broader sell-off, leveraged altcoin positions will unwind, leading to liquidations and subsequent pressure to sell. Coupled with the reduced liquidity and lower market depth of altcoins, several tokens could face a decline in excess of 10%.\n\nThe ideal scenario for altcoins is Bitcoin climbing above the 124,000, a level of resistance, and moving higher before another period of consolidation. That would allow capital to rotate without the risk of an immediate correction.",

While the information is relevant and offers some practical insights into market dynamics, the lack of detailed verification for claims and insufficient context regarding historical trends diminishes its trustworthiness. The organization of the content is somewhat disjointed, with long paragraphs and repetitive information that could be streamlined for better readability.

Its the knock-on effect that spurred trading activity. More about that later.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.While the second- and third-largest cryptocurrencies have outpaced their larger rival in the past seven and 30 days, its worth noting BTC has climbed more than 40 in the past three months and hit a new record high. Market participants are betting the party isnt over yet, the derivatives market shows.Bitcoins options market now carries a2.36 billion wagerthe price will clear 140,000, data from Deribit shows. That single strike price holds the most open interest on the exchange, double the OI of the busiest put option, or bet on a decline.Ether options show a similar pattern. The 4,000 call leads with 651 million in open interest, and another 280 million is targeting 6,000. The data shows how heavily the market is tilting bullish even after ETH surged more than 125 in just three months.As the prices rise, the money flows in. Spot bitcoin ETFs have already brought in 5.41 billion this month, the most since November 2024, when President Donald Trump was elected on a pro-crypto platform. Spot ether ETFs saw net inflows of 2.88 billion, the highest since August 2024,SoSoValuedata shows. As an aside, to underpin the altcoin narrative,net inflowsinto the ether ETFs beat those for bitcoin ETFs yesterday.To Boris Alergant, the head of institutional partnerships at Babylon Labs, these flows underscore the shift from speculative retail to long-term institutional allocation.The regulatory environment is part of the story. The GENIUS Act, expected to be signed into law later today, tightens rules for yield-bearing stablecoins. The law is seen as nudging treasurers toward native ETH staking and transparent restaking vaults.Robinson Burkey, co-founder of the Wormhole Foundation, told CoinDesk the GENIUS act, along with the Clarity Act are the first meaningful answers to the crypto markets requests for rules that wont stifle innovation.Trump is also expected to sign an executive order in the near future opening up 401K plans to investments beyond stocks and bonds. That wouldopen the 9 trillion U.S. retirement marketto cryptocurrency, gold and other investments.Its plausible that the meaningful progression of legislative matters could be the catalyst for unlocking further participation from risk-averse capital that has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for regulatory certainty, Babylon Labs Alergant told CoinDesk.When you combine structural demand, tightening BTC supply post-halving, and a potentially favorable policy backdrop, the setup for this market remains incredibly strong.Still, bitcoins share of the market has been dropping this month and the broad CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index is up 32 this month, outperforming the bitcoin-heavy CoinDesk 5 (CD5), which rose 17 in the same period. Bitcoin dominance, which measures bitcoins weighting in what is now a more than 4 trillion market cap, has dropped to 61.7 from 65.5 on June 30.The infrastructure has matured, stablecoins are proven, liquidity is deeper, and execution is faster, making this cycle feel more durable than past rallies. Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told CoinDesk Its a pivotal moment for on-chain finance to prove its staying power.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nIn this article\n\nBTC 118,738.05 0.26\nXRP 3.2394 8.62\n\nBy Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nWhile bitcoin (BTC) 118,738.05 is pretty much back to where it was 24 hours ago, ether (ETH) and XRP 3.2394 extended their gains after the House of Representatives passed the first major crypto regulatory initiative in the U.S. even though the legislation is aimed at stablecoins. It's the knock-on effect that spurred trading activity.\n\nMore about that later.\n\nDon't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.\n\nWhile the second- and third-largest cryptocurrencies have outpaced their larger rival in the past seven and 30 days, it's worth noting BTC has climbed more than 40% in the past three months and hit a new record high. Market participants are betting the party isn't over yet, the derivatives market shows.\n\nBitcoin's options market now carries a $2.36 billion wager the price will clear 140,000, data from Deribit shows. That single strike price holds the most open interest on the exchange, double the OI of the busiest put option, or bet on a decline.\n\nEther options show a similar pattern. The 4,000 call leads with $651 million in open interest, and another $280 million is targeting 6,000. The data shows how heavily the market is tilting bullish even after ETH surged more than 125% in just three months.\n\nAs the prices rise, the money flows in. Spot bitcoin ETFs have already brought in $5.41 billion this month, the most since November 2024, when President Donald Trump was elected on a pro-crypto platform. Spot ether ETFs saw net inflows of $2.88 billion, the highest since August 2024, SoSoValue data shows. As an aside, to underpin the altcoin narrative, net inflows into the ether ETFs beat those for bitcoin ETFs yesterday.\n\nTo Boris Alergant, the head of institutional partnerships at Babylon Labs, these flows underscore the shift from speculative retail to long-term institutional allocation.\n\nThe regulatory environment is part of the story. The GENIUS Act, expected to be signed into law later today, tightens rules for yield-bearing stablecoins. The law is seen as nudging treasurers toward native ETH staking and transparent restaking vaults.\n\nRobinson Burkey, co-founder of the Wormhole Foundation, told CoinDesk the GENIUS Act, along with the Clarity Act, are the first meaningful answers to the crypto markets' requests for rules that won't stifle innovation.\n\nTrump is also expected to sign an executive order in the near future opening up 401K plans to investments beyond stocks and bonds. That would open the $9 trillion U.S. retirement market to cryptocurrency, gold, and other investments.\n\nIt's plausible that the meaningful progression of legislative matters could be the catalyst for unlocking further participation from risk-averse capital that has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for regulatory certainty, Babylon Labs' Alergant told CoinDesk.\n\nWhen you combine structural demand, tightening BTC supply post-halving, and a potentially favorable policy backdrop, the setup for this market remains incredibly strong.\n\nStill, bitcoin's share of the market has been dropping this month and the broad CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index is up 32% this month, outperforming the bitcoin-heavy CoinDesk 5 (CD5), which rose 17% in the same period. Bitcoin dominance, which measures bitcoin's weighting in what is now a more than $4 trillion market cap, has dropped to 61.7% from 65.5% on June 30.\n\nThe infrastructure has matured, stablecoins are proven, liquidity is deeper, and execution is faster, making this cycle feel more durable than past rallies. Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told CoinDesk it's a pivotal moment for on-chain finance to prove its staying power.\n\nStay alert!\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nCrypto July 18: Lorenzo Protocol, a Cosmos-based blockchain with native token BANK, launches USD1 OTF on BNB Chain's mainnet. The institutional-grade on-chain traded fund lets users stake stablecoins to mint sUSD1 tokens that earn stable, NAV-backed yield from real-world assets, CeFi quantitative strategies, and DeFi protocols. All returns are settled in USD1 stablecoin, issued by World.",

The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing Americas leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bills passage by Congress.The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors  Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland  and two Republican co-sponsors  South Carolinas Sen. Tim Scott and Wyomings Sen. Cynthia Lummis.Heres what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.What is stablecoin?Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.In a recent interview withCBS News Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle, described stablecoins as digital dollars. As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.At the end of the day, its about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms, Disparte said.Disparte estimates that around 90 of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.What will the Genius Act do?Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bills sponsor,saidstablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than taking weeks.Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get depegged from its underlying asset if that assets value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity,accordingto SP Global Ratings.In 2023, for example,the failure of U.S. banksSilicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins  the USDC and DAI to depeg.Stablecoins are also subject to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity, according to SP Global.Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nations largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the companys earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency.

If current inflows continue—even through the typically subdued summer period—we could see Bitcoin breach 140k by September, with a potential surge toward 150k in early October.\n\nUnderlying demand for Bitcoin appears strong with elevated open interest in options at 130,000 for August 1 expiry, Deribit data shows. Bitcoin fell 1.5% to about 117,665 on Friday.\n\n--With assistance from Emily Nicolle and Kirk Ogunrinde. (Updates prices.)",

The average lowest price prediction sits at 87,618, with some predicting that Bitcoin will fall as low as 70,000.The cryptocurrency has recently reached 120,000 from just below 100,000 at the end of last year.There are a number of factors increasing demand for Bitcoin, including clearer and more favourable regulations, increased utility such as payments, and changing economic conditions, crypto exchange Zondacryptos CEO, Przemysław Kral, told Euronews.He added that regulations such as the EUs MiCA contributed significantly to the recent rally. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) sets uniform EU market rules for crypto-assets. This, coupled with an increased interest from institutional players, largely in the form of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), made crypto more accessible for many.Cryptocurrency-based ETFs make it easier for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to buy them directly. These funds have exploded in popularity since Bitcoin ETFs began trading in US markets last year.RelatedTrump Media eyes Bitcoin reserve with 2.3 billion investor backingBitcoin reaches new record high ahead of US Houses Crypto WeekIs there a bubble around Bitcoin?While the integration of crypto into mainstream finance has genuinely boosted interest towards Bitcoin, there is a possibility that a so-called bubble is forming. In other words, the price is being blown up by investor interest without fundamentals supporting it.According to Northeastern Universitys crypto expert and professor of international business and strategy Ravi Sarathy, big institutional investors, including MicroStrategy, have been accumulating large pools of this asset, and it is possible that they are propping up the price of the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy holds a Bitcoin stash worth approximately 65bn.After the previous reluctant approach from institutional investors, new US measures authorising Bitcoin ETF funds have made it easier and more convenient for both institutions and retail investors to invest some of their resources in these higher riskhigher return Bitcoin vehicles, Sarathy told Euronews Business.Bitcoin issuance has a ceiling of 21 million, driving rising demand in the face of a limited supply. This has also led to the rise of Digital Asset Treasuries (a corporate strategy, ed.) which seek investor funds to invest in a variety of cryptocurrencies and tokens, including Bitcoin, a further fillip to demand, and fuelling rapid Bitcoin price appreciation, Sarathy said, adding that after a short reaction to further US legislation, longer-term price appreciation could still continue.How Washington is fuelling Bitcoins rallyInterest in Bitcoin has increased dramatically since US President Donald Trump widely campaigned to make the US the world capital for crypto. The US administrations support for crypto assets reached new highs recently as the government dubbed this week Crypto Week. Lawmakers in the House are debating a series of bills that could define the regulatory framework for the industry in the United States.Bitcoin and crypto in general, is being propped up by the Trump administration, ironically given its initial promotion as an alternative to government-backed currencies and support from libertarians, said John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra.He believes that the token lacks any fundamental value, and after 16 years, it has still failed to meet its initial aspiration to be a common means of payment. It remains a speculative bubble.Others see Trumps support as a reason to buy.Rouge International  Rouge Ventures managing director, Desmond Marshall, said that Together with Trumps embrace of digital crypto assets, his sons dealing with huge amounts of crypto projects and the strong US dollar, the US government is already buying large reserves of BTC. This is supported by many businesses venturing into this realm with enterprise crypto strategies.The most bullish crypto specialists, expecting a large price increase, bet that Bitcoin could reach 250,000, buoyed by institutional demand.Corporate and institutional demand is not slowing down while retail is still absent and nation state adoption is just getting started, said Martin Froehler, CEO of",

          "cleaned_content": "After the world’s most popular cryptocurrency recently reached a new record, it is expected to further increase in value, reaching levels beyond $160,000 in 2025.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to reach a high of 162,353 this year (139,148), before it settles at around 145,167 (124,418). That’s according to UK fintech firm Finder's latest survey, collecting price predictions from 24 crypto industry specialists. Within responses, high and low estimates range widely, and the most optimistic predictions expect a peak price of 250,000 this year. The average lowest price prediction sits at 87,618, with some predicting that Bitcoin will fall as low as 70,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has recently reached 120,000 from just below 100,000 at the end of last year.\n\nThere are a number of factors increasing demand for Bitcoin, including clearer and more favourable regulations, increased utility such as payments, and changing economic conditions, crypto exchange Zondacryptos CEO, Przemysław Kral, told Euronews. He added that regulations such as the EU's MiCA contributed significantly to the recent rally. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) sets uniform EU market rules for crypto-assets. This, coupled with an increased interest from institutional players, largely in the form of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), made crypto more accessible for many. Cryptocurrency-based ETFs make it easier for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to buy them directly. These funds have exploded in popularity since Bitcoin ETFs began trading in US markets last year.\n\n### Is there a bubble around Bitcoin?\n\nWhile the integration of crypto into mainstream finance has genuinely boosted interest towards Bitcoin, there is a possibility that a so-called bubble is forming. In other words, the price is being blown up by investor interest without fundamentals supporting it. According to Northeastern University's crypto expert and professor of international business and strategy Ravi Sarathy, big institutional investors, including MicroStrategy, have been accumulating large pools of this asset, and it is possible that they are propping up the price of the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy holds a Bitcoin stash worth approximately 65bn.\n\nAfter the previous reluctant approach from institutional investors, new US measures authorising Bitcoin ETF funds have made it easier and more convenient for both institutions and retail investors to invest some of their resources in these higher risk-higher return Bitcoin vehicles, Sarathy told Euronews Business. Bitcoin issuance has a ceiling of 21 million, driving rising demand in the face of a limited supply. This has also led to the rise of Digital Asset Treasuries (a corporate strategy, ed.) which seek investor funds to invest in a variety of cryptocurrencies and tokens, including Bitcoin, a further fillip to demand, and fuelling rapid Bitcoin price appreciation, Sarathy said, adding that after a short reaction to further US legislation, longer-term price appreciation could still continue.\n\n### How Washington is fuelling Bitcoin's rally\n\nInterest in Bitcoin has increased dramatically since US President Donald Trump widely campaigned to make the US the world capital for crypto. The US administration's support for crypto assets reached new highs recently as the government dubbed this week Crypto Week. Lawmakers in the House are debating a series of bills that could define the regulatory framework for the industry in the United States.\n\nBitcoin and crypto in general, is being propped up by the Trump administration, ironically given its initial promotion as an alternative to government-backed currencies and support from libertarians, said John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra. He believes that the token lacks any fundamental value, and after 16 years, it has still failed to meet its initial aspiration to be a common means of payment. It remains a speculative bubble.\n\nOthers see Trump's support as a reason to buy. Rouge International Rouge Ventures managing director, Desmond Marshall, said that together with Trump's embrace of digital crypto assets, his sons dealing with huge amounts of crypto projects and the strong US dollar, the US government is already buying large reserves of BTC. This is supported by many businesses venturing into this realm with enterprise crypto strategies.\n\nThe most bullish crypto specialists, expecting a large price increase, bet that Bitcoin could reach 250,000, buoyed by institutional demand. Corporate and institutional demand is not slowing down while retail is still absent and nation state adoption is just getting started, said Martin Froehler, CEO of.",

A Flip Could Be Coming.\n\nA weakening dollar has provided a solid lift to early second-quarter earnings, but it could be masking softness in domestic demand and potential pressures on profit margins as tariffs increase over the coming months. The greenback has fallen nearly 9.5% so far this year and is pinned near the lowest levels since 2022 amid a mixture of slowing growth prospects, rising fiscal deficits and worries over the safety of longer term investment in American assets. Data from Apollo Global suggests companies within the benchmark generate around 41% of their total revenue from outside the U.S., and a weaker dollar increases their value when it comes to financial reporting.",

This means the dollar has reached its lowest value since the Nixon years, when the price of gold was unlinked from the USD in 1973, creating a rapid decline in the dollars value.This decline is being felt most by Americans traveling abroad. Since the dollar has dropped 13 against the euro and 6 against the Japanese yen, international travellers are experiencing the pain of an increased summer vacation budget when visiting trendy destinations like Tokyo, Rome, Paris and Barcelona.Dont missThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can nowbecome a landlord for as little as 100 and no, you dont have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Heres howIm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement  what should I do? Dont panic. Here are5 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)You dont have to be a millionaire to gain access tothis 1B private real estate fund. In fact, you can get started with as little as 10  heres howThis time around, the sudden drop is happening partly due to President Donald Trumps recurring tariff threats creating an isolationist foreign policy, according to the New York Times.With Trumps recently passed big, beautiful bill set to increase the debt by 3.4 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, inflation worries and rising government debt are also pushing the value of the dollar down further.So what does this mean for your investments?Here are four ways to protect your retirement fund when the USD takes a nosedive.Let gold work its magicSince the value of gold is no longer tied to any particular country or currency, it can be a great way to hedge against a dropping dollar.A recent report from JPMorgan notes that the current share of gold in foreign exchange (FX) reserves is more than double the 4 seen a decade ago, which highlights the current bull market gold is experiencing.With prices forecast to climb toward 4,000 per ounce by mid-2026, these gold highs dont appear to be going away anytime soon. This means a percentage of assets in gold could be a solid strategy for growing your investments while the dollar is down.If you want to get some tax advantages while youre at it, one option is opening agold IRA with the help of Priority Gold.Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assetswithin a retirement account, combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold. This can make them a good option if youre seeking to shield your retirement funds against a declining dollar.Story ContinuesWhen you make a qualifying purchase with Priority Gold, you canreceive up to 10,000 in precious metalsfor free.Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market here are the alternative assets theyre banking on insteadInvest in the housing marketReal estate provides another solid option for diversifying your portfolio against market shocks.A weaker dollar makes U.S. real estate more attractive to foreign investors as their purchasing power increases, noted Private Banker International during a previous dollar dip in 2023.A decrease in the dollars purchasing power typically leads to rising inflation. While this isnt great for your pocketbook, inflation leads to real estate prices rising due to the increased cost of materials.This means rental income tends to increase, giving landlords a revenue stream that adjusts with inflation.But, if you dont want to be a landlord, there are other options for tapping into real estate as an alternative asset. One opportunity is the 34.9 trillion home equity market.Homesharesallows accredited investors who dont want the headache of buying, owning or managing property the ability to invest in hundreds ofowner-occupied homes in top U.S. citiesthrough their U.S. Home Equity Fund.With a 25,000 initial investment, Homeshares can provide an effective, hands-off way toinvest in high-quality residential propertiesminus the stress of being a landlord.And if youre curious about short-term rental investing, but dont want the hassle of being a host, theres an easier option.Arrived offers access to shares ofSEC-qualified investments in rental homes and vacation rentals, vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Backed by world class investors like Jeff Bezos,Arrivedmakes it easy to add real estate to your portfolio to protect yourself against market swings.Even better, you can get in the door with a100 initial investmentto see if Arrived is a good fit for you.Consider adding fine art to your portfolioFine art investing can help set your portfolio up for success even when the dollar is low.Fine art is kno",

          "cleaned_content": "USD sees worst start in 50 years thanks in part to Trump's tariffs but for investors it's not all bad news\n\nThe USD has dropped 10% over the last six months alone, according to the U.S. Dollar Index. This means the dollar has reached its lowest value since the Nixon years, when the price of gold was unlinked from the USD in 1973, creating a rapid decline in the dollar's value.\n\nThis decline is being felt most by Americans traveling abroad. Since the dollar has dropped 13% against the euro and 6% against the Japanese yen, international travelers are experiencing the pain of an increased summer vacation budget when visiting trendy destinations like Tokyo, Rome, Paris, and Barcelona.\n\nThis time around, the sudden drop is happening partly due to President Donald Trump's recurring tariff threats creating an isolationist foreign policy, according to the New York Times. With Trump's recently passed big, beautiful bill set to increase the debt by 3.4 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, inflation worries and rising government debt are also pushing the value of the dollar down further.\n\nSo what does this mean for your investments? Here are four ways to protect your retirement fund when the USD takes a nosedive.\n\n### Let gold work its magic\nSince the value of gold is no longer tied to any particular country or currency, it can be a great way to hedge against a dropping dollar. A recent report from JPMorgan notes that the current share of gold in foreign exchange (FX) reserves is more than double the 4% seen a decade ago, which highlights the current bull market gold is experiencing. With prices forecast to climb toward $4,000 per ounce by mid-2026, these gold highs don't appear to be going away anytime soon. This means a percentage of assets in gold could be a solid strategy for growing your investments while the dollar is down.\n\nIf you want to get some tax advantages while you're at it, one option is opening a gold IRA with the help of Priority Gold. Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold. This can make them a good option if you're seeking to shield your retirement funds against a declining dollar.\n\n### Invest in the housing market\nReal estate provides another solid option for diversifying your portfolio against market shocks. A weaker dollar makes U.S. real estate more attractive to foreign investors as their purchasing power increases, noted Private Banker International during a previous dollar dip in 2023. A decrease in the dollar's purchasing power typically leads to rising inflation. While this isn't great for your pocketbook, inflation leads to real estate prices rising due to the increased cost of materials. This means rental income tends to increase, giving landlords a revenue stream that adjusts with inflation.\n\nBut, if you don't want to be a landlord, there are other options for tapping into real estate as an alternative asset. One opportunity is the $34.9 trillion home equity market. Homeshares allows accredited investors who don't want the headache of buying, owning, or managing property the ability to invest in hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund. With a $25,000 initial investment, Homeshares can provide an effective, hands-off way to invest in high-quality residential properties minus the stress of being a landlord.\n\nAnd if you're curious about short-term rental investing, but don't want the hassle of being a host, there's an easier option. Arrived offers access to shares of SEC-qualified investments in rental homes and vacation rentals, vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Backed by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived makes it easy to add real estate to your portfolio to protect yourself against market swings. Even better, you can get in the door with a $100 initial investment to see if Arrived is a good fit for you.\n\n### Consider adding fine art to your portfolio\nFine art investing can help set your portfolio up for success even when the dollar is low. Fine art is known to appreciate over time, providing a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. Investing in fine art can diversify your portfolio and potentially yield significant returns in the long run.",

Additionally, there is no explanation of the implications of banning crypto donations or the stakeholders involved in this debate.

But the company stopped reporting subscriber numbers earlier this year, shifting focus to metrics like revenue and profit, a move that has raised concerns about growth.The streaming giant, whose 517-billion market value is more than the combined worth of Disney, Comcast and Warner Bros Discovery, posted quarterly earnings per share of 7.19, beating estimates of 7.08, according to data compiled by LSEG.A strong content slate in the second half of the year and growing traction for its advertising efforts could help support continued revenue gains in the third quarter and beyond, said Seth Shafer, principal analyst at SP Global Market Intelligence Kagan.At least 16 analysts raised their price targets on the stock following the results, bringing the median target to 1,385, as per data compiled by LSEG.(Reporting by Joel Jose, Siddarth S and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Leroy Leo)TermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

Expectations were running high for the streaming giant, after its shares nearly doubled in value in the past year and viewers binged on content such as the final season of South Korean survival drama Squid Game in the second quarter.\n\nBut executives said much of the increase in the annual forecast was driven by weakness in the U.S. dollar, now predicting revenue of between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, up from $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion previously. \"When your shares are already binge-watched to perfection, the earnings beat needed to be stronger to satisfy expectations,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors.\n\nInstead, some sold on the good news and maybe questioned whether the positive FX effect will be there a few quarters down the road. A crackdown on password-sharing, more sports content, and its ad-supported tier helped Netflix draw tens of millions of new viewers in 2024. But the company stopped reporting subscriber numbers earlier this year, shifting focus to metrics like revenue and profit, a move that has raised concerns about growth.\n\nThe streaming giant, whose $517 billion market value is more than the combined worth of Disney, Comcast, and Warner Bros Discovery, posted quarterly earnings per share of $7.19, beating estimates of $7.08, according to data compiled by LSEG. A strong content slate in the second half of the year and growing traction for its advertising efforts could help support continued revenue gains in the third quarter and beyond, said Seth Shafer, principal analyst at SP Global Market Intelligence Kagan. At least 16 analysts raised their price targets on the stock following the results, bringing the median target to $1,385, as per data compiled by LSEG.",

The relevance score of 6.0 shows that the topic is significant in the current political landscape, but the structure score of 4.0 reveals disorganization and redundancy in presentation. The historical score of 6.0 suggests some alignment with trends in regulatory scrutiny over cryptocurrency, while the human score of 4.5 indicates moderate readability and practical value but low engagement. Overall, the content requires significant improvements in context, depth, and organization to enhance its quality and effectiveness."
