Congress Can Future-Proof the U.S. Financial System: Summer MersingerThe head of the Blockchain Association says lawmakers have an opportunity to renew American financial supremacy this week. But does Congress have the capacity for careful, technical legislation?BySummer MersingerEdited byBenjamin SchillerJul 14, 2025, 7:46 p.m.When Congress established the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, it was responding to myriad failures of an antiquated financial system. The regulatory architecture that emerged provided the foundation for nearly a century of American financial dominance. Today, Congress faces a comparable moment: the opportunity to modernize Americas financial infrastructure for the digital age.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Two pieces of legislation now before lawmakers, the GENIUS Act on stablecoins and comprehensive market structure reform, represent more than incremental policy adjustments. Together, they constitute Americas response to a fundamental shift in how money moves around the world.The stakes are considerable. The 240 billion stablecoin market,projected to reach 3.7 trillion by 2030, has emerged as critical financial infrastructure largely outside formal regulatory frameworks. Nearly all major stablecoins peg voluntarily to the dollar, creating a curious phenomenon: private companies building elaborate technology to make American currency work better globally than existing payment systems.This development comes as Americas monetary hegemony faces its most serious challenge in generations. Chinas digital yuan initiatives, BRICS alternative payment systems, andgrowing reluctanceamong trading partners to transact in dollars signal a coordinated effort to circumvent American financial influence.Stablecoins offer Americasmost effective response. They expand dollar accessibility globally while preserving the transparency and rule-of-law advantages that make the American financial system attractive. The GENIUS Act would formalize this system, establishing reserve requirements, audit standards and consumer protections that make dollar-backed digital assets both safer and more attractive than alternatives.Yet currency infrastructure alone cannot suffice. The current approach of applying 20th-century regulations to 21st-century technology has produced predictable results: innovation migrating to jurisdictions with clearer and more welcoming rules.The November federal court ruling thatvacated the SECs expanded dealer definitionillustrates the problem. Regulators had stretched statutory language so far beyond original intent that judicial intervention became inevitable.Digital asset platforms integrate functions that traditional finance deliberately separates, creating new efficiencies alongside new risks. Forcing these platforms into regulatory categories designed for different business models produces neither clarity nor protection. Comprehensive market structure legislation would establish bespoke registration frameworks that actually correspond to how these businesses operate, something the crypto ecosystem has been advocating for years.The integration imperative here is crucial. U.S. financial supremacy in the 20th century derived not from any single innovation but from systematic coordination across monetary policy, market regulation and institutional oversight. Todays challenge demands similar coherence. Digital dollar infrastructure without a proper market structure leaves innovation vulnerable to regulatory uncertainty. Market structure reform without stablecoin clarity limits the global reach of American monetary policy.Internationalcompetitionintensifies this urgency. The European Unions Markets in Crypto-Assets(MiCA)regulation, the U.K.s stablecoin framework, and similar initiatives across Asia represent direct challenges to American leadership in financial technology. These frameworks may not be superior to what America could construct, but they exist, which is often a decisive advantage in attracting global investment and innovation.Indeed, there is another step that American elected officials can take to ensure that the promise of crypto isnt undermined: passRep. Tom Emmers legislationprohibiting the development in the United States of a central bank digital currency(CBDC). Whileseveral other countrieshave discussed such a rollout, American lawmakers should embrace our domestic privacy ideals and broad anti-surveillance sentiment by supporting this important legislation.The Senates 68-30 passage of the GENIUS Act suggests growing political recognition of cryptos policy potency and the realities of international competition. Even skeptical Democrats acknowledge the state-of-play, with Se",

(Jesse HamiltonCoinDesk)What to know:The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a statement today reminding bankers that there are rules to follow with the custody of digital assets.The U.S. bank regulators have had a dicey history with the crypto industry, but theyve recently shifted their positions toward less resistance of the financial movement.The Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking agenciesissued another statementon the proper handling of crypto assets on Monday, outlining the appropriate policies that need to be followed for banks engaging in the safekeeping of customers digital assets.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.The statement sent out from the Fed, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency made clear that these latest considerations do not represent a new policy push.The trio of agencies set out to clarify that properly keeping such assets involves controlling the cryptographic keys associated with the crypto-asset in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations.Apart from cryptographic key management, the seven-page memo outlined some of the demands of money-laundering controls, risk-management oversight, software knowledge and audits.This statement discusses how existing laws, regulations and risk-management principles apply to this activity, and does not create any new supervisory expectations, the agencies said.The U.S. banking regulators have had a tumultuous relationship with the digital assets space, having issued guidance during the previous administration of President Joe Biden that constrained bankers from easily doing business with crypto firms. But the regulators under President Donald Trump haverolled back that guidance.The latest sentiments from the agencies come at the start of the U.S. House of Representatives self-described Crypto Week in which the lawmakers areexpected to approve multiple crypto billsin an effort toward establishing formal U.S. digital assets regulations.Read More:Former Bitfury Exec Gould Confirmed to Take Over U.S. Banking Agency OCCRegulationFederal ReserveOffice of the Comptroller of the CurrencyFederal Deposit Insurance CorporationBanking RegulationJesse HamiltonJesse Hamilton is CoinDesks deputy managing editor on the Global Policy and Regulation team, based in Washington, D.C.

The stake is worth about 9.26 billion.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.God has a sense of humor, said Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who has also written The Bolge Effect. Vanguard chose this life. When you have an index fund, you have to own all the stocks, for better or worse, and that includes stocks that you may not like or approve of personally.Institutional dementia, said a somewhat less diplomatic Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck. Indexing into 9 billion of what you openly mock isnt strategy, he wrote in aposton X.Vanguards exposure comes from passively managed index funds, not a deliberate bet on bitcoin or Strategys strategy. MSTR is included in several of Vanguards funds, such as the Total Stock Market Index Fund(VITSX), the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund(VIEIX)and the Vanguard Growth ETF(VUG).These funds mirror the composition of broad stock indices and automatically include companies like Strategy when they meet certain criteria.Strategy, led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has converted itself into a bitcoin holding vehicle, acquiring more than 600,000 BTC worth now about 72 billion since 2020. The companys shares have become a proxy for bitcoin exposure, especially in the years before the U.S. approved spot bitcoin ETFs.Still, Vanguard remains opposed to the asset class. The firm has refused to offer clients access to bitcoin ETFs, even as competitors like BlackRock launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust(IBIT), which became the fastest ETF to manage over 80 billion in assets.Even the arrival of supposedly crypto-friendly CEO Salim Ramji in May last year hasnt shifted the firms position. I think its important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer, Ramji said after his appointment.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards.For more information, seeCoinDesks full AI Policy.VanguardStrategyHelene BraunHelene is a New York-based markets reporter at CoinDesk, covering the latest news from Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds and updates on crypto markets.

Were not going to let that happen, the bills sponsor, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer,postedback in the spring. This bill does not have a counterpart in the Senate either.All three pieces of legislation are expected to pass the House with bipartisan support. That would be a big win for the industry. The bills arent flawless, Dowling said, but even an imperfect framework will dispel the current regulatory ambiguity and help crypto companies operate in the U.S. The rough spots will likely be smoothed out over time, she argued.Other countries are already in the race, while were still lacing up our shoes, she told CoinDesk. But Washington has changed its attitude towards crypto incredibly quickly since Donald Trumps re-election and former SEC Chair Gary Genslers departure, she said.You have to keep that momentum up.

Meanwhile, retail investors dropped their BTC and ETH exposure from 46 to 37, shifting capital toward newer, more speculative tokens.This divergence isnt a temporary thing; Its the sign that we are experiencing a more mature, sophisticated and specialized crypto market, said Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO and founder of Wintermute.Investors are no longer chasing the same trend, he added. Institutions are treating crypto as a macro asset, while retail traders continue to gravitate to innovation.(Wintermute)Overall, traditional finance(TradFi)firms were the fastest-growing cohort in OTC trading volumes, growing 32 year-over-year. That growth was being fueled by regulatory developments like the U.S. GENIUS Act and the EUs ongoing MiCA rollout, which have given larger firms more confidence to participate, the report said.Retail brokers also saw strong activity, with a 21 rise in volume over the same period. Meanwhile, crypto-native firms dialed back, down 5.(Wintermute)OTC options volume jumped 412 compared to the first half of 2024, as institutions embraced derivatives for hedging and yield generation, the report noted. Meanwhile, Contracts for Difference(CFDs)doubled in variety, offering access to less liquid tokens in a more capital-efficient way.Wintermute said its own OTC desk saw spot trading volumes grow at more than twice the pace of centralized exchanges, signaling a shift toward more discreet, large-volume trading favored by traditional finance.The firm noted that memecoin activity has become more fragmented. While overall retail trading in memecoins declined, the number of tokens traded by individual users doubled, signaling a broadening appetite for micro-cap assets in the long tail of the market.With that, legacy names like dogecoinDOGE0.1935and shiba inuSHIB0.0₄1309lost ground to a growing list of niche tokens such as bonkBONK0.0₄2711, dogwifhatWIFand popcatPOPCAT0.3630, the report noted.Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, Wintermute analysts said to keep an eye on spot dogecoin ETF filings with spot with a final regulatory decision expected by October.The outcome could significantly impact the retail market and set a precedent for other alternative assets, the report said.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards.For more information, seeCoinDesks full AI Policy.WintermuteBitcoinMarketInstitutionsMemecoinAltcoinsKrisztian SandorKrisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

(Jesse HamiltonCoinDesk)What to know:The tentative schedule for Crypto Week in the U.S. House of Representatives could see a Wednesday vote on the Clarity Act and a Thursday morning vote on the GENIUS Act, according to industry insiders tracking the action.The congressional action is expected to push crypto legislation to unprecedented heights in the U.S. as the industry finds greater traction with lawmakers.If the stablecoin rules in GENIUS pass, that bill could soon become the first major crypto law in the U.S.The U.S. House of Representatives so-called Crypto Week is steaming toward mid-week votes on two foundational pieces of legislation that would push the industrys status forward significantly in the U.S., including what amounts to a final congressional action on regulating stablecoins.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.While that last necessary vote on the stablecoin bill known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins(GENIUS)Act would send it to President Donald Trumps desk to be signed into law, its the bigger bill  the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act  that is the top concern of the crypto industry.That legislation to establish a regulatory framework for U.S. crypto activity is expected to come up late afternoon on Wednesday for its floor vote, industry lobbyists have been advised, which would send the Clarity Act over to the Senate for its consideration. The House has made it that far before on a market structure bill for digital assets, but the Senate was immobile on the issue during the previous congressional session. This time, key senators are making promises to complete work on this issue quickly.The Clarity Act is widely expected to pass with a heavy bipartisan vote. Its predecessor, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act(FIT21)drew 71 Democrats when it passed. Theres tremendous pressure on the sector and among the Republican lawmakers leading the charge to garner more than that for Clarity, so it arrives in the Senate with high momentum.While Senator Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has said the Clarity Act will act as a template for his chambers work, crypto lobbyists have been told that the lawmakers there may not hew closely to its language, suggesting a coming period of negotiation.On Thursday morning, according to people familiar with the planning, the House is tentatively expected to vote on GENIUS, the bill to set up guardrails for issuers of stablecoins, such as Circles USDC and Tethers USDT. That bill already passed the Senate with a wide bipartisan approval, and House lawmakers agreed to take it as-is, meaning its course would finish soon on Trumps desk if it clears this last legislative step.The series of votes amounts to the most consequential week yet for the digital asset industry on Capitol Hill, according to Blockchain Association Senior Director of Government Relations Jessica Martinez.Before all this vote timing can be set in stone, the House Rules Committee met on Monday afternoon to work out the plan. The Rules panel sets the procedures for how each piece of legislation will be handled on the House floor.Lawmakers from the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees defended the trio of bills before the Rules Committee in a lengthy hearing taht extended into Monday night. The House is set to vote after an hour of debate on each bill, though no amendments will be considered.If Crypto Week follows the expected course, itll end with a crypto milestone for Congress, passing the first-ever major crypto regulatory bill. Once GENIUS is law, the industry will focus full-time on market structure, though its unclear how much work will need to be done to reach agreement between the House and Senate. Senator Scott said the Senate will be done with its work by Sept. 30.Instead of taking up Clarity, we think the Senate will put forth its own bill, but not before September, said Ian Katz, a policy analyst at Capital Alpha, though he doubts the final effort will be completed this year.Also this week, the House was prepared to pass another bill that would ban a U.S. central bank digital currency(CBDC). Republican lawmakers have made the case against the Federal Reserve issuing a digital dollar that they",

Yet these revolutions have largely failed to materialize.The issue isnt technology. Its that weve been building solutions looking for problems, rather than focusing on solving real challenges and delivering real value.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Most projects create tokens first, utility later. This speculation cycle has consumed the industry, measuring success by token price, not actual value creation. Were missing the crucial ingredient: a mechanism that rewards building useful things rather than building over-hyped useless things.What if there was a protocol that flipped this model and projects had to create value first, then get rewarded? Thats Bittensor.Bittensor: Rewarding Performance Over MindshareIn some waysBittensoris like the Y Combinator of AI. Whereas Y Combinator gives startups money and mentorship in exchange for equity, Bittensor gives builders incentives through token emissions, measures performance through free market dynamics, and rewards winners without human gatekeepers.Think of it as an economic game where independent teams compete to build valuable AI services. Every 12 seconds, the network distributes rewards based purely on usefulness. No marketing budgets. No insiders. No traditional fundraising. No KOLs. Just performance.The tokenomics are elegant yet powerful. Like Bitcoin, Bittensors native TAO has a fixed supply cap of 21 million, with 7,200 tokens distributed daily and supply halving every four years. This creates genuine scarcity in the form of rewards that must be earned through performance rather than speculation.Heres where it gets even more interesting: each subnet has its own alpha token that subnet participants earn. TAO holders can stake into subnets they believe in, receiving that subnets alpha tokens in return. Higher-performing subnets attract more TAO stake and get a larger share of daily emissions. This market-driven funding mechanism means that builders get paid only if their service actually works and successful projects automatically get more resources, while also rewarding those who staked.These performance-based rewards mean that anyone can build but the market decides the winner. And, since its open-source software, if a project isnt delivering, others create a better version.This makes Bittensor a transparent competition where all metrics are public. Its been called capitalistic Darwinism. In other words, create value or get out-competed.Why Bittensor Changes EverythingBig Techs grip on AI is only getting stronger. Bittensor represents our best chance at wresting control and anchoring innovation in an open, transparent, and democratic environment where value accrues to the most performant innovations, rather than closed systems that benefit from outsized network effects.For the public, Bittensor represents cryptos original promise: coordinating human effort toward valuable outcomes without intermediaries, committees, or gatekeepers. Value gets created first through competition, then tokens reward the creators; the opposite of hoping speculation drives value.For builders, this means skipping VC pitches, preserving equity, and getting rewarded immediately for building useful things. The most important infrastructure is being built by teams spending 0 on marketing, 0 on exchange listings with pure focus on value creation. Community governance ensures builders arent locked out from decision-making.For users, this creates access to quality-competing services rather than marketing-budget winners. Users benefit from the upside by supporting the best projects, while community governance creates strong bonds between creators and consumers.For investors, Bittensor offers AI exposure without having to pick individual winners. The staking mechanics drive value accrual into the network rather than siphoning it away. Investors earn upside by supporting top-performing projects while community governance gives them a voice rather than forcing them to follow a CEOs agenda.The timing couldnt be better. With over55 billion in fundinggoing to the AI sector in Q1 2025,1.39 billion in fundinggoing to AI agents in the past quarter, crypto funding validates what Bittensor has already built. While others are still fundraising, world-class AI teams are already building",

The elevated value translates to an expected 13 price swing for XRP over the coming seven days.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.The market is pricing much lower volatility in bitcoinBTC119,184.42. The seven-day implied volatility for the largest cryptocurrency has increased only slightly to an annualized 46, equivalent to an expected weekly price swing of about 6.XRPs annualized 7-day implied volatility. (Volmex)The sharp rise in XRPs implied volatility comes as the U.S. House of Representatives is set to review three major bills this week that could shape the digital assets industry.The first is the GENUIS Act, which, if passed, would require stablecoin issuers to hold liquid reserves, accept annual independent audits and publish monthly transparency reports.Also on the table is the CLARITY Act, which will clarify whether cryptocurrencies fall under the SEC or the CFTCs purview. Lastly, there is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, which will prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency. XRP, declared as a strategic U.S. asset by the SEC, stands to benefit from regulatory clarity.The GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act are especially important for setting institutional ground rules  clarifying how stablecoins should be issued and overseen, and formally defining the roles of the SEC and CFTC in overseeing crypto markets. Together, these steps address one of the core barriers to institutional participation: legal uncertainty, Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, the chief investment officer at crypto liquidity provider XBTO, said in an email.He added that the rulebook clarity will make long-term capital deployment viable, aligning the worlds largest economy with processes underway in regions like the UAE, where defined frameworks are already unlocking tokenized markets.If passed, these bills could open the door to wider stablecoin adoption, regulated tokenization, and on-chain financial products with full legal backing, he noted.Volatility is direction-agnosticNote that the implied volatility is direction-agnostic, meaning the expected 13 swing may not necessarily be bullish and can unfold in either direction.That said, XRP is currently exhibiting strong bullish momentum, trading over 5 higher on the day at 3, the level not seen since early February, according to CoinDesk data.XRPMarketsOmkar GodboleOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesks Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

Crypto Rallies as Pressure Mounts on Chairman Jerome PowellThe White Houses campaign for new Federal Reserve leadership amped higher over the weekend.ByStephen Alpher,Helene BraunEdited byStephen AlpherJul 14, 2025, 2:22 p.m.Pressure rises on Fed Chair Jerome Powell (Federal Reserve, modified by CoinDesk)What to know:The Trump administration has been targeting questions about the Feds 2.5 billion renovation project as a way to put more pressure on Chairman Powell to step down or as cause for his firing.Two supposed contenders for Powells replacement slammed the Fed leader over the weekend.A new Fed chair to be appointed by President Trump would surely be supportive of the White Houses continued calls for sharply lower interest rates.All things being equal, easier monetary policy tends to be good for risk assets  crypto surely among them. Bitcoin rallied to above 120,000 for the first time ever over the weekend as pressure on hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to step down or be fired amped even higher. Coincidence?To review, Jerome Powell  who rushed through 75 basis points of rate cuts prior to the 2024 election  quickly switched to a more hawkish stance following Donald Trumps election(though he did allow one more 25 basis point cut just after November), and it famously hasnt sat well with the president.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Frankly, its about breaking some heads,said former Fed Governor Kevin Warshon Fox News on Sunday. Warsh, who has been consistently touted as a leading possible replacement for Powell, added that the central banks 2.5 billion renovation project was among several examples of how the Fed has lost its way and said it was time for regime change.Also appearing on TV on Sunday and also another contender to lead a post-Powell Fed, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hasset said the presidents possible power to fire Jerome Powell is being looked into ... but certainly if theres cause, he does.The latest angle of attack against Powell is the Feds 2.5 billion renovation project. Powell is being questioned not just over the massive expense, but over whether he may have misled Congress in his testimony regarding the renovation. Office of Management and Budget(OMB)Director Russ Vought last week sent Powell a list of questions regarding the project.The Fed over the weekend created a newFAQ page on its websiteto give its side of the story.Trump doesnt ease upAdding his comments over the weekend, the president said it would be a great thing for the country if Powell were to exit.Jerome Powell has been very bad for our country, he added. We should have the lowest interest rate on Earth, and we dont. He just refuses to do it.I dont know what he knows about building, but you talk about cost overrun, Trump said of the 2.5 billion renovation. He reminded that the project was approved and began moving forward while Joe Biden was still president.Regulatory angle as wellWhile Powell has kept a publicly neutral stance towards crypto, a new Fed chair could be seen as a positive for the community even beyond what surely would be easier monetary policy.Powell, over the years, has maintained his stance that bitcoin is a competitor to gold rather than to the U.S. dollar given that people are not using it as a form of payment but rather as an investment vehicle.However, he has repeatedly called for clearer regulation, specifically around stablecoins and their risks to financial stability as the industry continued to grow more mainstream. He has also stressed the importance of consumer protections as well as concerns about debanking practices in which financial institutions are forced to cut ties with crypto firms due to the risks associated with the asset class.Federal ReserveBitcoinStephen AlpherStephen is CoinDesks managing editor for Markets.

Thats why Im concerned that too many Democrats are standing on the sidelines or standing in the way of one of the most transformative financial innovations of our time: blockchain and cryptocurrency.Blockchain and crypto are already driving job creation across the country, from data centers and fintech startups to cybersecurity firms and developers working on decentralized infrastructure. This technology means more jobs, higher wages, and more money in peoples pockets, especially in communities that have been left behind by the traditional financial system.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.The numbers dont lie. Voters overwhelmingly support integrating crypto into the American financial system. More thantwo-thirds of Americans believethere should be clearer rules and regulations for the crypto industry, rather than leaving it largely unregulated, according to multiple industry-leading public opinion polls.Andtwo-thirds believethe current global financial system favors powerful interests and not them. Democrats need to understand that voters want an alternative to the current financial system that provides them with the economic freedom that is so desperately needed. That is a winning middle class message.These numbers reflect a clear mandate for action. Yet our partys leadership has often approached crypto with skepticism or outright hostility, creating a partisan divide on an innovation that should transcend political boundaries.This misalignment became painfully evident during recent elections, with Republicans, including Donald Trump, having embraced crypto, while Democrats appeared out of touch with the technological revolution reshaping our economy. We cannot afford to cede this ground, especially when crypto and blockchain offer solutions to many of the economic challenges weve long sought to address.The Democratic Party has always stood for expanding economic opportunity and ensuring that working people arent taken advantage of by powerful financial institutions. As a lifelong entrepreneur and Virginias former governor, Ive seen how embracing innovation can open doors for workers, businesses, and families across every corner of our economy. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are no exceptionthey offer real tools to increase financial inclusion, expand access, and create good-paying jobs.This isnt just theory, it is what voters are telling us. Communities of color and younger Americans, especially young men, see real promise in crypto as a path to economic empowerment. These are core Democratic constituencies, and theyll be essential to winning back the map in 2028 and beyond. If we want to remain the party of opportunity, we have to lead the way on forward-looking regulationnot stand in the way of progress.Innovation in crypto means financial services for communities traditionally underserved by conventional banking systems, offering faster, cheaper transactions and broader access to capital. For minority communities, in particular, who have historically faced discrimination in traditional banking, crypto represents a path to financial empowerment through self-custody and consumer choice. Small businesses should not have to pay 3, 4 or 5 of their profits to companies when transactions can be done at a fraction of the cost. Crypto will create a system of payment that benefits consumers and small businesses everywhere.Now, we have a crucial opportunity to correct our course. The GENIUS Act, which now awaits action in the House, presents a framework for smart, progressive regulation positioning America as a global leader in stablecoins.Stablecoins are crypto tokens backed by U.S. dollars held in a bank that provide a cheaper and faster way of moving dollars than the dated ACH system. This legislation offers a balanced approach that both nurtures innovation, strengthens the U.S. dollar and establishes necessary guardrails.The GENIUS Acts provisions will streamline our financial system and eliminate costly fees that disproportionately affect small businesses and low-income Americans. It will mean Americans can send money to family abroad in milliseconds, for fractions of a penny, using dollar backed stablecoins like USDC on lightning-fast public blockchains like Solana. This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking policy t",

A few weeks prior to that, stock-trading app eToro(ETOR)also made the move. Its shares are now 10 higher.While Circle and eToro hit the market during challenging macroeconomic times due to tariff discussions led by President Donald Trump, both debuted at higher valuations than anticipated, suggesting renewed interest in digital assets as U.S. legislators inch closer to clearer rules for crypto companies, especially stablecoin issuers.Grayscales proposal, in contrast, comes at a time of bullish momentum for crypto assets. The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is hitting record highs on an almost daily basis. The token is currently trading at 121,728, up 30 year-to-date, and justovertook goldas the years best-performing asset.Grayscale is one of the largest crypto asset managers. Its core products are trusts and exchange-traded funds(ETFs)such as its flagship Graysale Bitcoin Trust(GBTC)and Ethereum Trust(ETHE), both of which converted into ETFs in January last year. The two alone have a combined 24 billion of assets under management.Both have suffered heavy outflows since their conversion because the asset manager charges a higher fee for its products than competitors, making it more expensive for investors to buy and hold the product.Many, however, believe that Grayscale is one of the reasons why the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved to begin with after itwon a legal fightagainst SEC over its spot bitcoin ETF application, ultimately leading to the approval of several bitcoin ETFs.UPDATE(July 14, 13:25 UTC):Changes lead photo.UPDATE(July 14, 13:48 UTC):Adds recent IPOs in fifth paragraph, Grayscale products, background starting in eighth.FastNewsIPOBreaking NewsGrayscaleAoyon AshrafAoyon Ashraf is CoinDesks Head of Americas.

Tornado Cash Dev Roman Storms Money Laundering Trial Kicks Off MondayIf convicted on all three charges, Storm faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison.ByCheyenne LigonEdited byNikhilesh DeJul 14, 2025, 1:05 p.m.NEW YORK, New York  Tornado Cash developer Roman Storms criminal money laundering is slated to begin in Manhattan on Monday morning, when Storms lawyers and prosecutors will begin to select a jury to oversee Storms four-week trial.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Storm was arrested in Washington state in 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business  charges which, if Storm is convicted, carry a maximum combined sentence of 45 years in prison. Storms fellow Tornado Cash developer, Russian national Roman Semenov, faces the same charges but remains at large. Another developer, Alexey Pertsev, wasconvicted of money launderingin the Netherlands in 2024 and sentenced to five years in prison, which he iscurrently appealing.At the heart of Storms case lies Tornado Cash, a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency mixing service, which the government has alleged was used to launder over 1 billion in criminal proceeds by bad actors  including the Lazarus Group, North Koreas state-sanctioned hacking operation, which they say constituted a violation of U.S. sanctions  while Storm and his colleagues turned a blind eye. Storms lawyers, meanwhile, haveargued that he was simply a developer of open-source, decentralized softwarewith legitimate, privacy-preserving uses who should not be held responsible for bad actors use of it.Theres certainly going to be a very vigorous defense here that they were writing code and that Tornado Cash was designed for privacy  that some people may have taken advantage of it, but Storm and his colleagues werent co-conspirators, said Mark Bini, a partner in Reed Smiths global regulatory and enforcement practice group. Mixers have been very controversial because theyve been used by lots of people doing bad things, no doubt about it, but the idea that some people would want to use them for privacy, thats a legitimate argument as well. Thats going to make for a fierce battle here.Storms trial has drawn the attention of many in the crypto industry, who haveraised concernsthat, if Storm is found guilty, it could mean that developers down the line areon the hookfor how people use their programs  something that could have devastating consequences for both the availability of privacy tools and the decentralized finance(DeFi)space as a whole. A host of major players in the industry, including investment firm Paradigm, and non-profit advocacy groups Coin Center and the DeFi Education Fund, have submitted amicus briefs in Storms defense.Others, however, have been more reluctant to accept Storms privacy defense. Economics writer J.P. Koenig wrote ina 2024 blog postthat, if Storm prevails at trial, it could potentially mean that anyone who wants to facilitate illegal activities would have a strong incentive to copy Tornado Cash, effectively turning their operation into a golem  a deathless artificial being run on smart contracts  and then throwing away the keys to avoid the law.Swiss blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger wrote ina blog postthat there are, in general, far more reasons why cyber criminals might want to use a mixing service than developers who legitimately want to obfuscate the movement of their personal funds.Shifting windsStorms trial begins as the U.S. government continues to overhaul its approach to the crypto industry  particuarly crypto regulation. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the White House has taken a friendlier stance towards the industry (whichpoured a whopping 130 millioninto congressional races in the 2024 elections and at least 18 million into Trumps inaugural committee alone), nudging regulators and law enforcement to do the same.Since Trump took office in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  which had taken on a bogeyman-like status under former Chair Gary Gensler for its so-called practice of regulation by enforcement  has formed an industry-friendly Crypto Task Force and dropped a slew of open cases and investigations into crypto companies. In anApril memo to staff, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche ordered U.S. Department of Justice(DOJ)staff to narrow their focus on crypto crime, instructing them that the agency would no longer be charging regulatory violations in cases involving crypto.Though some speculated that prosecutors would back down from their case against Storm in the wake of Blanches memo,the government pressed forward, dro",

Core inflation is expected to rise to 3.0, from 2.8.Should inflation fail to materialise or remain steady, questions may arise regarding the Feds recent decision not to cut rates, potentially intensifying calls for monetary easing, James Kniveton, senior corporate FX dealer at Convera, wrote in a client note.Calls from the White House for leadership changes at the Fed may increase.Trump on Monday renewed his attacks on Powell, saying interest rates should be at 1 or lower, rather than the 4.25 to 4.50 range the Fed has kept the key rate at so far this year.Fed funds futures traders have been pricing in 50 basis points of interest rate cuts by year-end, with the first reduction expected in September.Meanwhile, Chinas economy is likely to have cooled in the second quarter after a solid start to the year, as trade tensions and a prolonged property downturn drag on demand, raising pressure on policymakers to roll out additional stimulus to underpin growth.Data due on Tuesday is expected to show GDP grew 5.1 year-on-year in AprilJune, slowing from 5.4 in the first quarter, according to a Reuters poll.Story ContinuesShould the data disappoint, and Chinas economic situation continue to underwhelm expectations, this could maintain downward pressure on the Australian dollar, said Kniveton.The Aussie edged down slightly to 0.6542.(Reporting by Kevin Buckland; Editing by Sonali Paul)TermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

If passed the bill would require passage in the Senate.The act would clarify and divide regulatory authority between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Story ContinuesGerald Gallagher, General Counsel at Sei Labs, a digital asset firm, said the bills could be a game changer for the industry.GENIUS and CLARITY provide security and certainty for investors that previously were not available, either intentionally or unintentionally, he told AFP.This has been a long time coming.The Republican-led House is also considering a bill it calls the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act that aims to block the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC)  a digital dollar issued by the US Federal Reserve.Republicans argue that a CBDC could enable the federal government to monitor, track, and potentially control the financial transactions of private citizens, undermining privacy and civil liberties.It also would require passage in the Senate before going to Trump for his signature.arpstTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

It is also one of the best performing in emerging markets.Mexicos high interest rates and President Claudia Sheinbaums tempered approach toward Trump have helped lure in cash from investors reallocating money away from the US. And after months of repeated delays on the implementation of tariffs, money managers have grown more complacent, with reactions to fresh announcements largely contained as they look past Trumps threats to focus on the medium-term outlook.Markets know the drill, said Marco Oviedo, a senior strategist at XP Investimentos in Sao Paulo. The only risk that I see is if the Mexican government fails to deliver something that Trump wants on drug control that might leave tariffs high for longer or negotiations in limbo.Mexicos strong economic ties to the US have also worked in the pesos favor. The US doesnt intend to apply the 30 rate to USMCA-compliant goods, a White House official said on Saturday. The administration has previously said it will keep the exemption for Canada.Although Mexican officials were taken aback by Trumps latest tariff threat, US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said Saturday in Mexico City that Sheinbaum and Trump have a wonderful relationship and no partnership should be easier than between their two countries.Sheinbaum said Monday during her daily press conference that her government expects to reach a tariff deal with the US before an Aug. 1 deadline and has a plan if talks fail. Shes expected to meet later today with a Mexican trade negotiating team that was in Washington on Friday discussing the issue.The countrys rate differentials are another factor helping prop up the currency. The central bank has been cautious when lowering interest rates, keeping the peso on the radar of carry traders who borrow in lower-yielding currencies to buy those that offer higher yields. One-week implied volatility in the peso, which spiked amid US elections last year and again in April amid tariff threats, has remained largely subdued.After delivering a half-point cut that left the key rate at 8 last month, Governor Victoria Rodriguez embraced the likelihood of smaller reductions going forward in a July 9 speech. That helped the peso inch higher last week, outperforming as developing-world currencies slipped amid the latest barrage of tariff announcements.Story ContinuesThe rally in Mexico has gone beyond the currency. Local bonds and stocks have also gained in the wake of Trumps so-called Liberation Day on April 2 amid a positive backdrop for emerging markets as the dollar slips.The peso is trading incredibly well in the face of this, said Eric Fine, portfolio manager for emerging markets debt at Van Eck Associates. This reaction has many explanations, but EMFX and interest rates have had a great year despite tariff-dominated news flow.What Bloomberg strategists say:The proposal lacks clarity, particularly whether it replaces or supplements the existing 25 fentanyl-related levy, and does not address the treatment of USMCA-compliant goods. This omission is notable given that, as of May, approximately 83 of US imports from Mexico were exempt from tariffs due to USMCA provisions. The high amount of exemptions provides a large buffer to the potential fallout from Trumps trade letter.Brendan Fagan, FX Strategist, Markets Live.For the full analysis, click here(Updates with implied volatility gauge, strategist quote starting in eight paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThailands Changing Cannabis Rules Leave Farmers in a Tough SpotOur Goal Is to Get Their Money: Inside a Firm Charged With Scamming Writers for MillionsThe Turbulence Is Brutal: Four Shark Tank Businesses on TariffsThe New Third Rail in Silicon Valley: Investing in Chinese AITrumps Cuts Are Making Federal Data Disappear2025 Bloomberg L.P.TermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

Powell may not be impartial based on his actions during different periods of his tenure. Uh and to your point, that thats concerning to some people on on certain sides. And if it became kind of a proxy just for what President Trump wanted to do, maybe that would be concerning as well. But I think consensus is building across lines. People realize that these millennials are getting hurt. You know, people if you look at peoples, you know, insurance bills, if they look at their their refinancing rates, if you look at the amount of trapped equity in homes, people cant even access through helocks if they want to build an expansion uh uh to, you know, if theyre having another kid, they cant do an addition on their house because the costs is too much. People are trapped in houses bigger than they need if theyre 60, 70 because they cant trade from a 3 mortgage to a 7 even if theyre taking equity out and moving down. This is unnecessary stuff from a guy who candidly three times has been wrong. Autopilot on quantitative tightening, crashing the market 20, uh transitory. So his prediction records not good. And his summary of economic projections, if hes so clear inflations going to go up, why does he have real GDP at 1.4? That old dog dont hunt. You cant talk out of both sides of your mouth. Either were were going too fast and you got to keep rates high, or were going too slow and you got to bring them down, and Trump is saying, bring them down.02:28Speaker AMhm.02:52Why copper buyers are probably too late to the partyYahoo Finance Video5 days ago02:34Trumps latest Powell jab, 2025 rate cuts: What to knowYahoo Finance Video6 days ago02:55How bitcoin ETFs could ease concerns for crypto-wary investorsYahoo Finance Video7 hours ago03:56Food stock turmoil: Innovation is key for major food companiesYahoo Finance Video10 hours agoTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

The precious metal is priced in US currency, so the strength in the dollar makes it less attractive for foreign investors.Trump unleashed tariff threats this weekend, declaring a 30 rate for Mexico and the EU, and informing key trading partners of new rates that will kick in on Aug. 1 if they cannot negotiate better terms.Earlier, silver climbed above 39 an ounce amid tightening physical supply. The implied annualized cost of borrowing the metal for one month has jumped to more than 6, compared with the typical rate near zero.The expanding appetite for the metal has left the physical market under strain in London, where most silver is held by exchange-traded funds  meaning it isnt available to lend or buy. Since February, the volume of silver-backed ETFs has expanded by some 2,570 tons, according data compiled by Bloomberg.Silvers outperformance relative to gold means that the ratio between the two has dropped in recent months, though silver still remains relatively cheap historically. It currently takes about 86 ounces of silver to buy an ounce of gold, compared with a 10-year average of 80.Concerns over US trade policy have also helped to push the metal higher. Mexico, the largest producer of silver and a key supplier to the US market, has been hit with a 30 tariff threat. The terms of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement exclude silver from the latest levies, but some traders expressed concerns about the possibility that exemption could be threatened.The metal is up 32 this year, surpassing golds 27 gain. As well as being a haven asset, silver also has industrial uses, most notably in solar panels. The market is headed for a fifth year in deficit, according to the Silver Institute, an industry group.Silver fell 0.5 to 38.23 an ounce as of 4:13 p.m. in New York. Gold, platinum and palladium also slipped.
