Description: Bitcoin has reached yet another all-time high, surpassing $118,000 for the first time on Friday — as a flood of money continues to move into spot bitcoin ETFs, all while U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly influence makes its way through Washington.  The world’s most popular cryptocurrency later fell slightly under the $118,000 mark in the afternoon — but was still dancing close to the threshold around 4 p.m. ET, sitting about $8,000 higher than it was a month ago and more than double its price this time last year.  Last month, the Senate passed legislation that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what the industry hopes will be a wave of bills to bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.
