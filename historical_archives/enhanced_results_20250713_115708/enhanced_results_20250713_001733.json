At the same time, custodians like Anchorage and Fidelity are scaling institutional pipelines, while OTC desks are tightening spreads.Solana, now trading around 163, gained over 11 on the week amid renewed demand across retail and memecoin ecosystems. The chain continues to act as a high-beta proxy for risk-on sentiment. XRP, meanwhile, jumped 25, benefiting from both a technical breakout and rising speculation around regulatory resolution.Price action may grab the spotlight, TeraHash added, but the real breakthrough this summer is structural.The altcoin move is broad-based. Dogecoin has rallied 23 over the past week, driven by increased retail participation through platforms like Robinhood and Binance. XRP volumes have spiked on Korean exchanges, while Cardano, TRX, and AVAX are all trading firmly in the green.Meanwhile, Bitpanda Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that strong bitcoin rallies are often followed by significant movements in altcoins with a slight delay  and a potential comeback of meme coins cant be ruled out either.But not everyone sees a straight line up.Despite briefly touching this key milestone, BTC remains below a major resistance zone, said Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, said in an email.A decisive breakout and sustained move above this level could trigger a sharp upward rally, potentially targeting the 130,000 range, Lienkha added.btcShaurya MalwaShaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.Shaurya holds over 1,000 in BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, SUSHI, CRV, NEAR, YFI, YFII, SHIB, DOGE, USDT, USDC, BNB, MANA, MLN, LINK, XMR, ALGO, VET, CAKE, AAVE, COMP, ROOK, TRX, SNX, RUNE, FTM, ZIL, KSM, ENJ, CKB, JOE, GHST, PERP, BTRFLY, OHM, BANANA, ROME, BURGER, SPIRIT, and ORCA.He provides over 1,000 to liquidity pools on Compound, Curve, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BurgerSwap, Orca, AnySwap, SpiritSwap, Rook Protocol, Yearn Finance, Synthetix, Harvest, Redacted Cartel, OlympusDAO, Rome, Trader Joe, and SUN.X iconLatest Crypto NewsIndian Crypto Exchange CoinDCX Denies Moving User Funds After WazirX Allegations6 hours agoStellar Performance From XLM as It Posts Top 24H Percentage Gain Among Top 20 Cryptos8 hours agoAnother BTC Mining Firm Moves Into Ethereum Reserve, Hailing ETH as Digital Gold10 hours agoPump.fun Swiftly Raises 500M in Public Sale at 4B Fully Diluted Valuation11 hours agoTether to Halt USDT on Omni, BCH, Kusama, EOS, Algorand as Focus Shifts to Layer 2s12 hours agoCoinbases Pudgy Penguin Avatar Change, ETF Hopes Ignite 60 PENGU Rally12 hours agoTop StoriesPump.fun Swiftly Raises 500M in Public Sale at 4B Fully Diluted Valuatio\n                    Source: coindesk\n                    Published: Sat, 12 Jul 2025 07:34:55 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    "

The House is set to vote on market structure and stablecoin legislation next week, bringing the U.S. a vital step closer to drafting new rules for the industry.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Youre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government.Click hereto sign up for future editions.Crypto winThe narrativeThe U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a market structure bill, a stablecoin bill and a bill banning a U.S. central bank digital currency next week. Perhaps its premature to suggest the industry will notch a major win  but all signs indicate that U.S. President Donald Trump will sign a stablecoin bill into law before the August recess, as his team has sought since February.Why it mattersThe crypto industry has long sought regulatory clarity on its own terms  previous rule proposals it disagreed with wereferventlyopposedand the industrys political action committees poured tens of millions of dollars into the 2024 elections to try and create a Congress that would be friendlier to crypto policies.Next week, those efforts may pay off, as the House of Representatives gets set to vote on a stablecoin bill that may become law within weeks and a market structure bill that could get to the White House before Christmas.Breaking it downThe House of Representatives dubbed next week  July 14 to July 18  Crypto Week. The main event will be the House vote on, and expected passage of, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025(Clarity), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025(GENIUS).The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet Monday at 4:00 p.m. ET todiscusseach ofthe bills. That means there may be a floor vote, where the entire House votes, by Tuesday. Though there was some discussion of packaging the Clarity and GENIUS Acts into one larger bill, it appears there will instead be separate votes for each of the bills. If the GENIUS Act does receive its own vote, U.S. President Donald Trump may sign it into law as soon as next Friday or the following Monday, Im told, though at this point none of this is confirmed(and obviously depends on the actual House vote).Notably, the House Financial Services Committeeconfirmed on Thursdaythat the House would vote on the GENIUS Bill sent to it by the Senate, and not its own Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy(STABLE Act),as previously reportedby CoinDesks Jesse Hamilton.It is likely that all three bills will pass, and with bipartisan majorities.To recap: The Clarity Act will create a framework for how different cryptocurrencies are treated by federal regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Theres no Senate counterpart to this bill yet, though the Senate Banking Committee has already held multiple hearings on market structure issues, and the Senate Agriculture Committee has scheduled a hearing for this upcoming Tuesday on the same topic. Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott previously said he expects the Senate to wrap up its work on market structure by Sept. 30.The Houses last effort to pass market structure legislation, last years Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, sawmassive bipartisan supportwith 279 lawmakers(208 Republicans and 71 Democrats)voting in favor of the bill.While there is no public whip count yet for this years version, the Clarity Act passed out of the House Agriculture Committee with massive bipartisan support(47-6)and the House Financial Services Committee with some bipartisan support(32-19).Either numbersuggests both Democrats and Republicans will vote for the bill on the House floor.The GENIUS Act will set up a framework for overseeing stablecoins. The Senate already passed the GENIUS Act, meaning once the House passes it, it goes to Trumps desk for his signature into law. This could mark the stablecoin bill as the first major crypto-focused bill to become law.The GENIUS Act could then also be one of the few bills that isnt a must-pass to go through the legislative process, meaning its not a budget bill and its not the annual National Defense Authorization Act. While the House is voting on the Senate version and not its own STABLE Act,updated House textin the Clarity Act would add some additional rules around stablecoins.The Anti-CB",

Japanese firm Metaplanet(3350), which began aggressively accumulating BTC in 2024, now owns 15,555 coins worth roughly 1.83 billion. That translates to an unrealized profitof 284 million.Meanwhile, El Salvador, the first nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender,holds 6,234 BTCworth nearly 733 million at current prices. Its bitcoin bet has turned into a 232 million paper gain, a significant reversal from the losses it faced during the 2022 bear market.Smaller firms are riding the rally too. Semler Scientific(SMLR), which followed Strategys treasury strategy last year, owns 4,636 BTC and sits on160 million in unrealized gains. Frances Blockchain Group(ALTBG)holds 900 BTC, and still has30.5 million in gains on paper.While these companies could lock in massive profits by selling, most havent budged. In the bitcoin community, many of these holders are known as maxis  short for maximalists  who believe in holding the asset indefinitely. Some may take profits over time, but others, like Saylor, have stated publicly they plan to hold forever.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards.For more information, seeCoinDesks full AI Policy.MicroStrategyMetaPlanetSemler scientificHelene BraunHelene is a New York-based markets reporter at CoinDesk, covering the latest news from Wall Street, the rise of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds and updates on crypto markets.

A portion of the proceeds will support Upexis existing operations, while the rest will be used to grow its cryptocurrency treasury, with a specific focus on SolanaSOL160.97.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.As part of the equity component, Upexi raised 50 million from accredited and institutional investors, including its CEO Allan Marshall. Shares were sold at 4.00 each, with management purchasing at a premium of 4.94. The company said the equity deal is expected to close around July 14.Separately, Upexi entered into agreements to issue 150 million in convertible notes to institutional investors. The notes are backed by SOL as collateral and carry a 2 annual interest rate. They are convertible into Upexi stock at a fixed price of 4.25 per share and mature in 24 months.

Upon closing of the new financing, Upexi expects to more than double its current SOL position.The offerings were conducted privately and are not registered with the SEC.Technical AnalysisSOL demonstrated exceptional resilience throughout the preceding 24-hour period from 10 July 15:00 to 11 July 14:00, progressing from 156.45 to 166.65, constituting a substantial 6.52 appreciation with an aggregate trading range of 10.99 extending from 155.78 to 166.76.The price dynamics unveiled distinctive accumulation sequences with considerable volume-backed support materialising at 160.31 during the 21:00 hour advancement, where extraordinary volume of 3.23 million substantially surpassed the 24-hour mean of 1.34 million, corroborating institutional capital deployment.Pivotal resistance emerged proximate to 165.30, subjected to multiple examinations between 22:00 and 03:00, whilst the conclusive breakthrough above 166.00 transpired with amplified volume of 2.26 million, intimating persistent bullish conviction.The technical architecture suggests SOL has consolidated a superior trading corridor with robust volume validation, establishing foundations for prospective advancement towards the 170.00 psychological threshold.Throughout the concluding 60-minute interval from 11 July 13:05 to 14:04, SOL encountered considerable volatility whilst preserving its overarching bullish disposition, oscillating within a 2.90 bandwidth from 164.24 to 166.76 and settling at 165.87, representing a marginal 0.44 contraction from the hours commencement at 165.92.The period manifested quintessential consolidation attributes encompassing two discrete phases: an initial retreat to 164.28 circa 13:33 accompanied by intensified distribution pressure of 45,017 volume, succeeded by a vigorous recovery commencing at 13:48 where volume escalated to 81,740 during the ascent towards 166.76, validating renewed accumulation interest.Fundamental support crystallised near 164.30 with multiple successful examinations, whilst resistance materialised around 166.50-166.75, establishing a well-delineated trading corridor that suggests constructive price discovery following the antecedent 24-hour advance, positioning SOL for potential continuation of its broader upward trajectory upon completion of this consolidation phase.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance fro",

A portion of the proceeds will support Upexis existing operations, while the rest will be used to grow its cryptocurrency treasury, with a specific focus on SolanaSOL160.97.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.As part of the equity component, Upexi raised 50 million from accredited and institutional investors, including its CEO Allan Marshall. Shares were sold at 4.00 each, with management purchasing at a premium of 4.94. The company said the equity deal is expected to close around July 14.Separately, Upexi entered into agreements to issue 150 million in convertible notes to institutional investors. The notes are backed by SOL as collateral and carry a 2 annual interest rate. They are convertible into Upexi stock at a fixed price of 4.25 per share and mature in 24 months. The notes are expected to close around July 16, at which point the associated SOL will be added to the companys holdings.In a June 26press release, Upexi disclosed that it held 735,692 SOL as of June 24, an 8 increase from the 679,677 SOL reported on May 28. Upon closing of the new financing, Upexi expects to more than double its current SOL position.The offerings were conducted privately and are not registered with the SEC.Technical AnalysisSOL demonstrated exceptional resilience throughout the preceding 24-hour period from 10 July 15:00 to 11 July 14:00, progressing from 156.45 to 166.65, constituting a substantial 6.52 appreciation with an aggregate trading range of 10.99 extending from 155.78 to 166.76.The price dynamics unveiled distinctive accumulation sequences with considerable volume-backed support materialising at 160.31 during the 21:00 hour advancement, where extraordinary volume of 3.23 million substantially surpassed the 24-hour mean of 1.34 million, corroborating institutional capital deployment.Pivotal resistance emerged proximate to 165.30, subjected to multiple examinations between 22:00 and 03:00, whilst the conclusive breakthrough above 166.00 transpired with amplified volume of 2.26 million, intimating persistent bullish conviction.The technical architecture suggests SOL has consolidated a superior trading corridor with robust volume validation, establishing foundations for prospective advancement towards the 170.00 psychological threshold.Throughout the concluding 60-minute interval from 11 July 13:05 to 14:04, SOL encountered considerable volatility whilst preserving its overarching bullish disposition, oscillating within a 2.90 bandwidth from 164.24 to 166.76 and settling at 165.87, representing a marginal 0.44 contraction from the hours commencement at 165.92.The period manifested quintessential consolidation attributes encompassing two discrete phases: an initial retreat to 164.28 circa 13:33 accompanied by intensified distribution pressure of 45,017 volume, succeeded by a vigorous recovery commencing at 13:48 where volume escalated to 81,740 during the ascent towards 166.76, validating renewed accumulation interest.Fundamental support crystallised near 164.30 with multiple successful examinations, whilst resistance materialised around 166.50-166.75, establishing a well-delineated trading corridor that suggests constructive price discovery following the antecedent 24-hour advance, positioning SOL for potential continuation of its broader upward trajectory upon completion of this consolidation phase.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance fro\n                    Source: coindesk\n                    Published: Fri, 11 Jul 2025 16:04:19 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    "

When consumers buy and sell crypto assets, they deserve transparency in their transactions, Uthmeier said. Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive.At the heart of Uthmeiers allegation is Robinhoods payment for order flow(PFOF)business model. PFOF allows Robinhood to offer commission-free trading by instead generating revenue from routing its customer trades through market makers in exchange for a cut of the profits. Critics of the practice  which Robinhood also uses for stock trading  have complained that PFOF presents an inherent conflict of interest, potentially incentivizing the company to route customers trades through the market maker offering the most commission, not the one with the best price for customers.In 2020, Robinhood paid 65 million to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC)enforcement action alleging that the company misrepresented the quality of its executions of customer trades. Robinhood did not admit or deny the SECs findings. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC considered banning PFOF but ultimately did not. PFOF is banned in the United Kingdom and will be banned in the European Union beginning next year.Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has long defended the practice, telling CNBC in 2023 that PFOF was inherently here to stay.Our disclosures are best-in-class  We disclose pricing information to customers during the lifecycle of a trade that clearly outlines the spread or the fees associated with the transaction and the revenue Robinhood receives. We are proud to be a place where customers can trade crypto at the lowest cost on average, said Robinhood Markets General Counsel Lucas Moskowitz in an emailed statement.Uthmeiers subpoena is seeking a slew of information from Robinhood, including documentation of how the platform determines pricing for transaction rebates or PFOF practices with market makers, documents containing comparative price analyses of other crypto exchanges, and documents relating to the sale or access of users crypto trading data.Robinhood has until the end of the month to respond to the Uthmeiers subpoena.Cheyenne LigonOn the news team at CoinDesk, Cheyenne focuses on crypto regulation and crime.

When consumers buy and sell crypto assets, they deserve transparency in their transactions, Uthmeier said. Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive.At the heart of Uthmeiers allegation is Robinhoods payment for order flow(PFOF)business model. PFOF allows Robinhood to offer commission-free trading by instead generating revenue from routing its customer trades through market makers in exchange for a cut of the profits. Critics of the practice  which Robinhood also uses for stock trading  have complained that PFOF presents an inherent conflict of interest, potentially incentivizing the company to route customers trades through the market maker offering the most commission, not the one with the best price for customers.In 2020, Robinhood paid 65 million to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC)enforcement action alleging that the company misrepresented the quality of its executions of customer trades.

The SEC hadalready approved the conversionearlier this year but then issued a stay order to review the approval  without explaining why.Grayscale, the Exchange and the Funds current investors are suffering harm as a result of the delay, the company said in itsletter.The GDLC ETF would hold a basket of large-cap digital assets including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano, with around 80 of the fund currently weighted in bitcoin. The move to convert it into a spot ETF is part of Grayscales broader strategy to bring more crypto products to mainstream financial markets, following the launch of its spot bitcoinBTC117,622.48ETF in January.While the SEC has not clarified its reasons for the delay, market watchers suggest the hold islikely due to internal procedural issues, rather than political opposition to crypto.

Of these, Cardano and XRP dont currently have their own individual ETFs, and Solana just has one fund  with several applications hoping to add to this number.Scott Johnsson, a financial lawyer and ETF expert, said in apost on Xthat although the SECs move was out of the ordinary, it likely wont derail the fund entirely.Given Grayscale was suggesting they had productive talks with the SEC prior to approval, and they had made extensive amendments to the rule proposal in line with those discussions, my guess is the Rule 431 application was a parting gift from Crenshaw acting unilaterally, he wrote, referring to SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw.

In previous cycles, altcoins often moved in unison, rising as bitcoin consolidated and dropping en masse when it rose or fell.This time, however, seems different, possibly due to the increased participation of institutions in the the industry. The rise in DeFi tokens can be attributed to increasing institutional interest in ether(ETH), which could pave the way for a search for yield with firms battling to secure the highest returns.The same can be said for layer-2 networks.

Considering the company issuesUSDC(USDC-0.01), one of the most popular stablecoins around, many investors believe Circles stock is just getting started. So, could Circle Internet be a millionaire maker?Stablecoins keep things steadyStablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies designed to hold their valuerelative to a traditional fiat currency -- often the U.S. dollar. Where coins likeBitcoinandDogecoinare subject to dramatic swings in price, stablecoins are intended to never deviate more than a small fraction of a percent from the currency they are pegged to.Though other crypto ventures have tried more complicated mechanisms, Circle maintains USDCs peg to the U.S. dollar by simply holding 1 in cash or short-term Treasury papers for every USDC it issues. Any USDC in circulation is redeemable at any time for 1 in cash.So what is the point? USDC and other stablecoins provide many of the benefits of certain cryptocurrencies -- transactions are fast, cheap, and nearly frictionless -- without the fear of wild price swings. Like cash, theyre intended to be used, not hoarded.Circles revenue comes from TreasuriesDespite the shiny technology exterior, Circles revenue stream is simple. The company makes money through holding U.S. Treasuries. Circle, much like a bank, knows that only a fraction of all the USDC in circulation will be redeemed at any one time, so it only needs to keep a portion of reserves in cash to be instantaneously redeemable by USDC holders. It invests the rest in short-term U.S. Treasuries. Thats still a relatively liquid asset, but one that earns Circle interest income.This is functionally the entirety of Circles revenue source; of the 1.68 billion revenues the company collected in 2024, 1.66 billion was from reserve interest. So, to be clear, Circles revenue is directly tied to two main factors: how many USDC are in circulation (and therefore the size of the reserves from which it is earning interest) and U.S. Treasury rates.Stablecoins could be bigThere are currently 62.8 billion USDC in circulation. The company believes that it will grow significantly as adoption progresses throughout the wider economy.Theres ample reason to believe that is true. The GENIUS Act, a landmark bill that creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins and allows for their use in the banking industry, is working its way through Congress. Though some of the finer details may change, its more than likely it will be signed into law this year as its one of the few pieces of legislation today that has robust bipartisan support.Image source: Getty Images.An analysis fromCitilays out a bear, base, and bull case for the stablecoin market through 2030. Its base case sees roughly 1.6 trillion stablecoins in circulation five years from now, up from todays 234 billion. There is clearly a massive potential here.Its also likely that USDC captures a significant portion of this total market. Its currently second only toTether, but its rival wouldnt qualify under the GENIUS Act -- its reserve practices are somewhat opaque, and it uses volatile assets like Bitcoin as collateral. That puts USDC in a prime position.There are some serious complications, howeverThere are some key things to consider that complicate the issue, however. First, I think USDC could face significant competition not from Tether or other crypto native issuers, but from legacy institutions. Its been reported that some of the largest banks, likeJP Morgan ChaseandBank of America, have been in talks to create their own stablecoins. This would undermine the core of USDCs growth thesis. Circle and USDC could even face an official U.S. dollarcentral bank digital currency(CBDC) issued by the Federal Reserve itself.Heres another thing to consider. Circles revenue is directly tied to yields from U.S. Treasuries, which in turn are tied to the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. We are in an environment of relatively high interest rates, at least in the context of recent history.If rates are cut, which they likely will be later this year, Circles income will take a hit. According to an analysis by Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at the firm Fundstrat, every 0.25 drop in the Feds rate will equal a 10 drop in Circles revenue. Thats pretty significant.While I think stablecoin adoption will grow, I think investors are getting ahead of themselves. Right now, the stock is overvalued. I think that there aretoo many long-term risks and not enough of a moatto call Circle a millionaire-maker.",

Circles stock price rose all the way to 103.75 per share on the first day of active trading. In other words, investor interest was red-hot.And it hasnt cooled down much. Circles stock closed this Thursdays trading session at 202.90 per share.Circle Internets stablecoin expertiseWhy am I talking about a popular (and arguably underpriced) stock sale in this stablecoin analysis? Because thats Circle Internets bread and butter.Circle Internets flagship product isUSDC(USDC-0.01). Its one of the largest and most active U.S. dollar stablecoins on the market today, co-managed by Circle Internet and crypto-trading services veteranCoinbase Global.USDC is available on many crypto exchanges worldwide, but its main function is to make Coinbases trading system run smoothly. There are 62.8 billion USDC coins available today, with a daily transaction volume of 15.6 billion. In the filings leading up to Circle Internets stock offering, management claimed that 25 trillion had changed hands in the seven-year lifetime of USDC.And its a surprisingly profitable venture. A digital coin thats always worth a dollar may not sound like a cash machine, but Circle collected 19.5 billion of financing cash flow and 345 million of cash from operations in 2024. The company backs its digital assets with an equal amount of cash reserves, which generate income by being invested in ultra-safe securities. You know,like any old bank.Stablecoin heavyweightsCircle Internet is not the only stablecoin game in town. Perhaps inspired by the USDC backers impressive financial filings and moneymaking initial public offering (IPO), a plethora of surprising names are stepping into the stablecoin arena.The list includes some of the worlds largest banks, giant credit card processorsMastercardandVisa, and online payments expertPayPal-- just to name a few. Some of these classic financial powerhouses are launching their own stablecoins. Others are partnering up with Circle Internet and other specialists, and a few are simply embracing the use of existing stablecoins. Either way, old-school bankers are suddenly getting mighty comfortable with the concept of encrypted ledgers of digital transactions -- the core concept behind every stablecoin.Whats next for stablecoins?Stablecoins are making their way into everyday financial transactions. The coins themselves will not see price increases from this trend, but their backers might get generous as stablecoin management becomes increasingly profitable.Coinbase offers rewards for holding USDC coins, similar to a 4.1 annual interest rate. Other coins and different platforms offer even higher interest rates. The stablecoins are not always as rock-solid as USDC, so you have to calculate your appetite for digital currency risks before jumping into those potentially lucrative accounts. But interest rates and other owner-friendly features may become more attractive and profitable over time.Meanwhile, I expect the explosion of new stablecoins to continue for a while. It will slow down and stop someday, perhaps reversing for a while as the stablecoin market simplifies itself to a handful of preferred coins. This process will take years, though. For now, I just cant wait to see Circle Internets firstfinancial report as a public company, and Ill keep an eye on follow-up IPO announcements in the space.",

You know,like any old bank.Stablecoin heavyweightsCircle Internet is not the only stablecoin game in town. Perhaps inspired by the USDC backers impressive financial filings and moneymaking initial public offering (IPO), a plethora of surprising names are stepping into the stablecoin arena.The list includes some of the worlds largest banks, giant credit card processorsMastercardandVisa, and online payments expertPayPal-- just to name a few. Some of these classic financial powerhouses are launching their own stablecoins. Others are partnering up with Circle Internet and other specialists, and a few are simply embracing the use of existing stablecoins. Either way, old-school bankers are suddenly getting mighty comfortable with the concept of encrypted ledgers of digital transactions -- the core concept behind every stablecoin.Whats next for stablecoins?Stablecoins are making their way into everyday financial transactions. The coins themselves will not see price increases from this trend, but their backers might get generous as stablecoin management becomes increasingly profitable.Coinbase offers rewards for holding USDC coins, similar to a 4.1 annual interest rate. Other coins and different platforms offer even higher interest rates. The stablecoins are not always as rock-solid as USDC, so you have to calculate your appetite for digital currency risks before jumping into those potentially lucrative accounts. But interest rates and other owner-friendly features may become more attractive and profitable over time.Meanwhile, I expect the explosion of new stablecoins to continue for a while. It will slow down and stop someday, perhaps reversing for a while as the stablecoin market simplifies itself to a handful of preferred coins. This process will take years, though. For now, I just cant wait to see Circle Internets firstfinancial report as a public company, and Ill keep an eye on follow-up IPO announcements in the space.\n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Sat, 12 Jul 2025 15:27:00 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: crypto\n                    "

The denim company scored especially solid growth in the Americas and Europe.Story Continues- Key figures at around 2050 GMT -New York - Dow: DOWN 0.6 percent at 44,371.51 (close)New York - SP 500: DOWN 0.3 percent at 6,259.75 (close)New York - Nasdaq Composite: DOWN 0.2 percent at 20,585.53 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.4 percent at 8,941.12 (close)Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.9 percent at 7,829.29 (close)Frankfurt - DAX: DOWN 0.8 percent at 24,255.31 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.2 percent at 39,569.68 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 0.5 percent at 24,139.57 (close)Shanghai - Composite: FLAT at 3,510.18 (close)Eurodollar: DOWN at 1.1690 from 1.1701 on ThursdayPounddollar: DOWN at 1.3497 from 1.3579Dollaryen: UP at 147.38 yen from 146.26 yenEuropound: UP at 86.59 pence from 86.16 penceBrent North Sea Crude: UP 2.5 percent at 68.64 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: UP 2.8 percent at 66.57 per barrelburs-jmbdesTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

The denim company scored especially solid growth in the Americas and Europe.Story Continues- Key figures at around 2050 GMT -New York - Dow: DOWN 0.6 percent at 44,371.51 (close)New York - SP 500: DOWN 0.3 percent at 6,259.75 (close)New York - Nasdaq Composite: DOWN 0.2 percent at 20,585.53 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.4 percent at 8,941.12 (close)Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.9 percent at 7,829.29 (close)Frankfurt - DAX: DOWN 0.8 percent at 24,255.31 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.2 percent at 39,569.68 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 0.5 percent at 24,139.57 (close)Shanghai - Composite: FLAT at 3,510.18 (close)Eurodollar: DOWN at 1.1690 from 1.1701 on ThursdayPounddollar: DOWN at 1.3497 from 1.3579Dollaryen: UP at 147.38 yen from 146.26 yenEuropound: UP at 86.59 pence from 86.16 penceBrent North Sea Crude: UP 2.5 percent at 68.64 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: UP 2.8 percent at 66.57 per barrelburs-jmbdesTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info\n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Fri, 11 Jul 2025 21:07:25 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: macro\n                    "

Designed to maintain a fixed value, these tokens provide a reliable way for traders to manage risk, reduce transaction fees and even earn passive income.However, not allstablecoinsare created equal, and some carry greater risks than others.These are the largest stablecoins on the market, how they work, their unique features and the potential risks involved.6 largest stablecoins in the worldCoinMarket capTether (USDT)159.1 billionUSDC (USDC)63.13 billionDai (DAI)5.37 billionEthena USDe (USDe)5.33 billionWorld Liberty Financial USD (USD1)2.2 billionFirst Digital (FDUSD)1.45 billion1. Tether (USDT)Market cap:159.1 billionTetheris often hailed as the first successful stablecoin. With 149.27 billion in assets as of March 2025  mostly low-risk U.S. Treasury bills, plus some Bitcoin and gold  Tether is a financial heavyweight. In 2024, Tether brought in 13 billion in profit, or roughly double that of BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager.Tether Holdings, the company behind Tether, issues coins to a select group of direct customers, mostly trading firms. These clients wire real U.S. dollars to Tether, which are then used to purchase assets, mainly U.S. Treasurys, to back the value of the coins.Once in circulation, Tether can be traded for other cryptocurrencies through exchanges and brokerages.Tethers stability was put to the test in May 2022, a key moment in the history of stablecoins. The crash of Terras UST, the third-largest stablecoin at the time, triggered a wave of panic selling that briefly broke Tethers peg, dropping its value to 92 cents on some exchanges. By June 2022, it had rebounded to around 99 cents, and on July 20, 2022, Tether fully regained its dollar peg.2. USDC (USDC)Market cap:63.13 billionUSDC is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, and it operates on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. Its managed by Circle, a financial technology company. USDCs stability is ensured by a reserve of U.S. dollars, where each USDC token is backed by a corresponding dollar held with verified partners, often financial institutions.To create new USDC, users deposit U.S. dollars with Circle, which then issues an equivalent amount of USDC tokens on theblockchain. This process ensures every USDC in the market is backed by a real U.S. dollar.While initially managed by a consortium called Centre, co-founded byCoinbaseand Circle, Circle has since assumed sole responsibility for the management of USDC. However, Coinbase still maintains a minority stake in Circle.Story Continues3. Dai (DAI)Market cap:5.37 billionDai is a decentralized stablecoin operating on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to maintain a stable value of one U.S. dollar through the use of smart contracts and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as MakerDAO.Unlike centralized stablecoins like Tether, Dais issuance and management are decentralized, with no one entity controlling the process. Users can deposit different cryptocurrencies as collateral into smart contracts, which then mint DAI tokens. These collateralized assets help maintain DAIs peg to the U.S. dollar.Dais model has evolved over time. Initially, it relied primarily on Ethereum as collateral. More recently, it has expanded its collateral base to include USDC and real-world assets like U.S. Treasury bills.While supporters say this diversification helps bolster Dais stability, its also generated criticism from some in the crypto community who advocate for apurely decentralized approach.4. Ethena USDe (USDe)Market cap:5.33 billionEthena USDe is a decentralized, synthetic stablecoin that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.Because USDe is decentralized, it doesnt rely on centralized institutions to manage its reserves. Instead, USDe uses whats called cash-and-carry trade, a kind of arbitrage that takes advantage of the price differences between Ethereum and some of itsfinancial derivatives.Heres how it works:Ethena, the parent company of USDe, takes money used to buy USDe and uses that money to buy Ethereum (going long) while simultaneously betting against its price (going short) using financial derivatives.This strategy attempts to neutralize the price risk of USDe, and it offers buyers a yield by staking the Ethereum and collecting payments from the short derivatives positions.This hedging strategy lets USDe keep its dollar value regardless of whether Ethereums price rises or falls. The strategy doesnt come without risk, though. Its short positions could fail if the exchanges where Ethena places these trades collapse or face liquidity issues, such as during a market crash.In fact, USDe has recently faced scrutiny from German regulators that allege Ethena doesnt have enough capital backing for its stablecoin.

      "content": "MIT Economist Rebuts Bitcoin Hype: No Imminent Threat To The Dollar As A Means Of PaymentDavid OkoyaFri, Jul 11, 2025, 12:46 PM4 min readIn This Article:BTC-USDUSDXBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.Bitcoin as a widely accepted means of payment or a replacement for the dollar remains nothing but a pipe dream, according to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professorOlivier Blanchard.We are not close to sic shift to bitcoin as a general means of payment, Blanchardsaidlast week on X.Blanchards remarks contrast with recent statements from some Bitcoin proponents amid mounting U.S. debt concerns and dollar weakness year-to-date. Just last month, billionaire investor Tim Drapersaidthe dollar is going extinct while predicting a flight to Bitcoin among retailers in the next decade.Dont Miss:Warren Buffett once said, If you dont find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die. Hereshow you can earn passive income with just 10, starting today.100k in investable assets?Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes no cost, no obligation.According to Blanchard, however, the only way he sees Bitcoin becoming widely accepted as a means of payment is by a presidential mandate. As an example, he said a U.S. president could require all prices and payments to be denominated in Bitcoin. He said that scenarios like these were previously inconceivable, suggesting that his view has shifted with the Trump administrations support of the asset that has culminated inthe establishmentof a strategic national reserve.Blanchard said that in the unlikely event that the shift to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange occurred, it would present two significant macroeconomic implications. For one, he said that the supply of money will be fixed, adding that this type of rigid monetary policy has historically proven to be very bad and fortunately has been abandoned, likely referring to the move away from the gold standard.Society moved away from the gold standard as it offered little flexibility for central banks to intervene in times of crisis, either by injecting more money into the economy or implementing interest rate cuts.Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly dont own yet.See which asset class has outpaced the SP 500 (1995-2024)  and with near-zero correlation.At the same time, Blanchard said that deflation could occur as GDP grows if Bitcoin served as money. Deflation could slow down the economy by discouraging spending. It could also make debts more difficult to pay as the value of money increases.Story ContinuesHopefully, these are just idle speculations, he said. But proponents of Bitcoin as a replacement for the dollar should explain how they handle these issues.Meanwhile, Blanchard is not only skeptical of Bitcoin as money. He has previously questioned the assets value proposition as a hedge in times of uncertainty.A Bubble AssetIn August, BlanchardsaidBitcoin was a bubble asset like gold. This description is rooted ina 1982 paperhe authored with fellow economist Mark Watson called Bubbles, Rational Expectations, and Financial Markets. In the paper, Blanchard and Watson theorize that gold is more susceptible to bubbles than blue chip stocks because its fundamentals are more difficult to assess than a firms financial reports.See Also: In terms of getting money back,these bank accounts put traditional checking and savings accounts to shame.The average investor is more likely to base his choice of whether or not to hold the asset on the basis of past actual returns, rather than on the basis of market fundamentals, they said.

Just last month, billionaire investor Tim Drapersaidthe dollar is going extinct while predicting a flight to Bitcoin among retailers in the next decade.Dont Miss:Warren Buffett once said, If you dont find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die. Hereshow you can earn passive income with just 10, starting today.100k in investable assets?Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes no cost, no obligation.According to Blanchard, however, the only way he sees Bitcoin becoming widely accepted as a means of payment is by a presidential mandate. As an example, he said a U.S. president could require all prices and payments to be denominated in Bitcoin. He said that scenarios like these were previously inconceivable, suggesting that his view has shifted with the Trump administrations support of the asset that has culminated inthe establishmentof a strategic national reserve.Blanchard said that in the unlikely event that the shift to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange occurred, it would present two significant macroeconomic implications. For one, he said that the supply of money will be fixed, adding that this type of rigid monetary policy has historically proven to be very bad and fortunately has been abandoned, likely referring to the move away from the gold standard.Society moved away from the gold standard as it offered little flexibility for central banks to intervene in times of crisis, either by injecting more money into the economy or implementing interest rate cuts.Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly dont own yet.See which asset class has outpaced the SP 500 (1995-2024)  and with near-zero correlation.At the same time, Blanchard said that deflation could occur as GDP grows if Bitcoin served as money. Deflation could slow down the economy by discouraging spending. It could also make debts more difficult to pay as the value of money increases.Story ContinuesHopefully, these are just idle speculations, he said. But proponents of Bitcoin as a replacement for the dollar should explain how they handle these issues.Meanwhile, Blanchard is not only skeptical of Bitcoin as money. He has previously questioned the assets value proposition as a hedge in times of uncertainty.A Bubble AssetIn August, BlanchardsaidBitcoin was a bubble asset like gold. This description is rooted ina 1982 paperhe authored with fellow economist Mark Watson called Bubbles, Rational Expectations, and Financial Markets. In the paper, Blanchard and Watson theorize that gold is more susceptible to bubbles than blue chip stocks because its fundamentals are more difficult to assess than a firms financial reports.See Also: In terms of getting money back,these bank accounts put traditional checking and savings accounts to shame.The average investor is more likely to base his choice of whether or not to hold the asset on the basis of past actual returns, rather than on the basis of market fundamentals, they said. Simply put, investors buy in because they believe the asset will go up because it has increased in the past, which sums up why many people hold Bitcoin.Blanchard said that despite the potential for irrational valuation, one could justify holding gold because it has historically performed well in bad times. On the other hand, he said that Bitcoin has failed to show similar strength in times of uncertainty.Despite Blanchards thoughts, or perhaps as proof of his theory, Bitcoin adoption continues to grow as the assets price soars. At last look, 1 BTC is exchanging hands for 109,000.Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83  Investors like Bill OReilly and Rudy Giuliani areusing this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.Image: ShutterstockThis articleMIT Economist Rebuts Bitcoin Hype: No Imminent Threat To The Dollar As A Means Of Paymentoriginally appeared onBenzinga.comTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info\n                    Source: yahoo_finance_crypto\n                    Published: Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:46:04 +0000\n                    Quality Score: 100\n                    Relevance Score: 100\n                    Category: macro\n                    "

The worlds most popular cryptocurrency later fell slightly under the 118,000 mark in the afternoon  but was still dancing close to the threshold around 4 p.m. ET, sitting about 8,000 higher than it was a month ago and more than double its price this time last year.Spot bitcoin ETFs opened up cryptocurrency investing more widelyafter launching last year and analysts have pointed to record inflows recently.

Why? Well, last night there was more evidence that President Trump is pushing through with his tariff agenda.00:00:24.330Speaker AHe announced a 35 tariff on Canada.00:00:29.250Speaker AHe also said that countries that hadnt received a letter from him yet should expect a tariff rate of between 15 and 20.00:01:00.440Speaker AWell, the president cited the lack of big adverse market reaction to the latest round of tariffs. Thats after US equities closed at record highs on Thursday.00:01:21.230Speaker AThe attention now turns to the European Union. President Trump warned EU nations to expect a tariff announcement targeted targeting the block as soon as today. Now remember, the EU has signaled its willing to accept a 10 universal tariff, but is seeking some exemptions.00:02:12.720Speaker ANow, the second thing to be aware of is the rise in the value of the dollar. At one point after the trade announcement last night, the Canadian dollar fell as much as 0.6 against the greenback. It paired back some of those losses now.00:02:46.000Speaker AHowever, the euro also slipped and is heading for a weekly decline of about 0.9.00:03:05.630Speaker AAlso supporting the dollar was were data suggesting labor market resilience and minutes from the Feds latest policy meeting that tempered market rate cut expectations.00:03:35.540Speaker ABut remember, the dollar index is down around 9 this year on worries that the data could soon reflect more widely the damage recent policy decisions are having on the worlds largest economy.00:04:06.330Speaker AAnd the final thing to know about is Bitcoin. It hit another record high, 118,407.96.00:04:41.690Speaker AIt wasnt the only cryptocurrency to have a stellar day. Ethereum jumped 5.7.00:05:02.690Speaker ANow, the new record possibly reflects that investors are willing to take on more risk, even in the face of more tariff announcements.00:05:24.440Speaker AThere may also be growing optimism over future legislative proposals, as Yahoo Finances Ines Ferre explains.00:06:06.486Ines FerreNow, anything that is, uh, sort of crypto related, especially when it comes to, um, Bitcoin, um, has been on fire, uh, this year. Uh, Robin Hood, Coinbase, uh, anything that has crypto, uh, uh, trading. So look, um, Bitcoin has been trading within this range of 10,000, uh, over the last couple of months. And and what analysts have been pointing out is its becoming a less and less volatile asset. So this is certainly bullish, uh, for the asset. Uh, you also have, of course, uh, all the developments that have been happening with stable coin as well. That has been very big and the tokenization of stocks. Thats been, thats going to be huge for the crypto industry as a whole. Im looking forward to next week as well because, uh, Congress is going to have sort sort of whats been dubbed the crypto week where they will be taking a look at three different bills, the, uh, Genius Act being one of them, which is at the house now after it was passed in the Senate. So thatll be interesting to see if this is the next catalyst that moves Bitcoin higher.04:14Magnificent 7 check-in: Why these 3 names might not belongYahoo Finance Video8 hours ago02:06How to find the best credit card to save on gasYahoo Finance Video10 hours ago03:46Bank earnings: Heres what investors  analysts are watchingYahoo Finance Videoyesterday03:12CoreWeave initiated with Buy rating at Argus: Trending TickersYahoo Finance VideoyesterdayTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",
