Meanwhile, retail investors dropped their BTC and ETH exposure from 46 to 37, shifting capital toward newer, more speculative tokens.This divergence isnt a temporary thing; Its the sign that we are experiencing a more mature, sophisticated and specialized crypto market, said Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO and founder of Wintermute.Investors are no longer chasing the same trend, he added. Institutions are treating crypto as a macro asset, while retail traders continue to gravitate to innovation.(Wintermute)Overall, traditional finance(TradFi)firms were the fastest-growing cohort in OTC trading volumes, growing 32 year-over-year. That growth was being fueled by regulatory developments like the U.S. GENIUS Act and the EUs ongoing MiCA rollout, which have given larger firms more confidence to participate, the report said.Retail brokers also saw strong activity, with a 21 rise in volume over the same period. Meanwhile, crypto-native firms dialed back, down 5.(Wintermute)OTC options volume jumped 412 compared to the first half of 2024, as institutions embraced derivatives for hedging and yield generation, the report noted. Meanwhile, Contracts for Difference(CFDs)doubled in variety, offering access to less liquid tokens in a more capital-efficient way.Wintermute said its own OTC desk saw spot trading volumes grow at more than twice the pace of centralized exchanges, signaling a shift toward more discreet, large-volume trading favored by traditional finance.The firm noted that memecoin activity has become more fragmented. While overall retail trading in memecoins declined, the number of tokens traded by individual users doubled, signaling a broadening appetite for micro-cap assets in the long tail of the market.With that, legacy names like dogecoinDOGE0.1989and shiba inuSHIB0.0₄1327lost ground to a growing list of niche tokens such as bonkBONK0.0₄2785, dogwifhatWIFand popcatPOPCAT0.3807, the report noted.Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, Wintermute analysts said to keep an eye on spot dogecoin ETF filings with spot with a final regulatory decision expected by October.The outcome could significantly impact the retail market and set a precedent for other alternative assets, the report said.Disclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards.For more information, seeCoinDesks full AI Policy.WintermuteBitcoinMarketInstitutionsMemecoinAltcoinsKrisztian SandorKrisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

(Jesse HamiltonCoinDesk)What to know:The tentative schedule for Crypto Week in the U.S. House of Representatives could see a Wednesday vote on the Clarity Act and a Thursday morning vote on the GENIUS Act, according to industry insiders tracking the action.The congressional action is expected to push crypto legislation to unprecedented heights in the U.S. as the industry finds greater traction with lawmakers.If the stablecoin rules in GENIUS pass, that bill could soon become the first major crypto law in the U.S.The U.S. House of Representatives so-called Crypto Week is steaming toward mid-week votes on two foundational pieces of legislation that would push the industrys status forward significantly in the U.S., including what amounts to a final congressional action on regulating stablecoins.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.While that last necessary vote on the stablecoin bill known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins(GENIUS)Act would send it to President Donald Trumps desk to be signed into law, its the bigger bill  the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act  that is the top concern of the crypto industry.That legislation to establish a regulatory framework for U.S. crypto activity is expected to come up late afternoon on Wednesday for its floor vote, industry lobbyists have been advised, which would send the Clarity Act over to the Senate for its consideration. The House has made it that far before on a market structure bill for digital assets, but the Senate was immobile on the issue during the previous congressional session. This time, key senators are making promises to complete work on this issue quickly.The Clarity Act is widely expected to pass with a heavy bipartisan vote. Its predecessor, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act(FIT21)drew 71 Democrats when it passed. Theres tremendous pressure on the sector and among the Republican lawmakers leading the charge to garner more than that for Clarity, so it arrives in the Senate with high momentum.While Senator Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has said the Clarity Act will act as a template for his chambers work, crypto lobbyists have been told that the lawmakers there may not hew closely to its language, suggesting a coming period of negotiation.On Thursday morning, according to people familiar with the planning, the House is tentatively expected to vote on GENIUS, the bill to set up guardrails for issuers of stablecoins, such as Circles USDC and Tethers USDT. That bill already passed the Senate with a wide bipartisan approval, and House lawmakers agreed to take it as-is, meaning its course would finish soon on Trumps desk if it clears this last legislative step.The series of votes amounts to the most consequential week yet for the digital asset industry on Capitol Hill, according to Blockchain Association Senior Director of Government Relations Jessica Martinez.Before all this vote timing can be set in stone, the House Rules Committee is meeting on Monday afternoon to work out the plan. The Rules panel sets the procedures for how each piece of legislation will be handled on the House floor.If Crypto Week follows the expected course, itll end with a crypto milestone for Congress, passing the first-ever major crypto regulatory bill. Once GENIUS is law, the industry will focus full-time on market structure, though its unclear how much work will need to be done to reach agreement between the House and Senate. Senator Scott said the Senate will be done with its work by Sept. 30.Instead of taking up Clarity, we think the Senate will put forth its own bill, but not before September, said Ian Katz, a policy analyst at Capital Alpha, though he doubts the final effort will be completed this year.Also this week, the House was prepared to pass another bill that would ban a U.S. central bank digital currency(CBDC). Republican lawmakers have made the case against the Federal Reserve issuing a digital dollar that theyve said might compete with U.S.-issued stablecoins and could give the government financial surveillance abilities over citizens. While the federal government hasnt pursued a CBDC in any significant way, the legislation would cut off an ability to do so in the future. The House is expected to vote on this bill on ",

Yet these revolutions have largely failed to materialize.The issue isnt technology. Its that weve been building solutions looking for problems, rather than focusing on solving real challenges and delivering real value.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Most projects create tokens first, utility later. This speculation cycle has consumed the industry, measuring success by token price, not actual value creation. Were missing the crucial ingredient: a mechanism that rewards building useful things rather than building over-hyped useless things.What if there was a protocol that flipped this model and projects had to create value first, then get rewarded? Thats Bittensor.Bittensor: Rewarding Performance Over MindshareIn some waysBittensoris like the Y Combinator of AI. Whereas Y Combinator gives startups money and mentorship in exchange for equity, Bittensor gives builders incentives through token emissions, measures performance through free market dynamics, and rewards winners without human gatekeepers.Think of it as an economic game where independent teams compete to build valuable AI services. Every 12 seconds, the network distributes rewards based purely on usefulness. No marketing budgets. No insiders. No traditional fundraising. No KOLs. Just performance.The tokenomics are elegant yet powerful. Like Bitcoin, Bittensors native TAO has a fixed supply cap of 21 million, with 7,200 tokens distributed daily and supply halving every four years. This creates genuine scarcity in the form of rewards that must be earned through performance rather than speculation.Heres where it gets even more interesting: each subnet has its own alpha token that subnet participants earn. TAO holders can stake into subnets they believe in, receiving that subnets alpha tokens in return. Higher-performing subnets attract more TAO stake and get a larger share of daily emissions. This market-driven funding mechanism means that builders get paid only if their service actually works and successful projects automatically get more resources, while also rewarding those who staked.These performance-based rewards mean that anyone can build but the market decides the winner. And, since its open-source software, if a project isnt delivering, others create a better version.This makes Bittensor a transparent competition where all metrics are public. Its been called capitalistic Darwinism. In other words, create value or get out-competed.Why Bittensor Changes EverythingBig Techs grip on AI is only getting stronger. Bittensor represents our best chance at wresting control and anchoring innovation in an open, transparent, and democratic environment where value accrues to the most performant innovations, rather than closed systems that benefit from outsized network effects.For the public, Bittensor represents cryptos original promise: coordinating human effort toward valuable outcomes without intermediaries, committees, or gatekeepers. Value gets created first through competition, then tokens reward the creators; the opposite of hoping speculation drives value.For builders, this means skipping VC pitches, preserving equity, and getting rewarded immediately for building useful things. The most important infrastructure is being built by teams spending 0 on marketing, 0 on exchange listings with pure focus on value creation. Community governance ensures builders arent locked out from decision-making.For users, this creates access to quality-competing services rather than marketing-budget winners. Users benefit from the upside by supporting the best projects, while community governance creates strong bonds between creators and consumers.For investors, Bittensor offers AI exposure without having to pick individual winners. The staking mechanics drive value accrual into the network rather than siphoning it away. Investors earn upside by supporting top-performing projects while community governance gives them a voice rather than forcing them to follow a CEOs agenda.The timing couldnt be better. With over55 billion in fundinggoing to the AI sector in Q1 2025,1.39 billion in fundinggoing to AI agents in the past quarter, crypto funding validates what Bittensor has already built. While others are still fundraising, world-class AI teams are already building",

(Dimitris VetsikasPixabay)What to know:XRPs seven-day implied volatility surged to 96, indicating potential double-digit price swings.The U.S. House is reviewing bills that could significantly affect the digital assets industry, including the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act.XRP is currently showing strong bullish momentum, trading over 5 higher at 3.The price of XRPXRP2.9400is likely to swing wildly over the next week, rising or falling more than 10 during Crypto Week on Capitol Hill, the tokens implied volatility indicates.Volmex Finances seven-day XRP implied volatility(IV)index jumped to an annualized 96 from last weeks 73, a significant premium to the seven-day historical volatility of 42. The elevated value translates to an expected 13 price swing for XRP over the coming seven days.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.The market is pricing much lower volatility in bitcoinBTC120,087.54. The seven-day implied volatility for the largest cryptocurrency has increased only slightly to an annualized 46, equivalent to an expected weekly price swing of about 6.XRPs annualized 7-day implied volatility. (Volmex)The sharp rise in XRPs implied volatility comes as the U.S. House of Representatives is set to review three major bills this week that could shape the digital assets industry.The first is the GENUIS Act, which, if passed, would require stablecoin issuers to hold liquid reserves, accept annual independent audits and publish monthly transparency reports.Also on the table is the CLARITY Act, which will clarify whether cryptocurrencies fall under the SEC or the CFTCs purview. Lastly, there is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, which will prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency. XRP, declared as a strategic U.S. asset by the SEC, stands to benefit from regulatory clarity.The GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act are especially important for setting institutional ground rules  clarifying how stablecoins should be issued and overseen, and formally defining the roles of the SEC and CFTC in overseeing crypto markets. Together, these steps address one of the core barriers to institutional participation: legal uncertainty, Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, the chief investment officer at crypto liquidity provider XBTO, said in an email.He added that the rulebook clarity will make long-term capital deployment viable, aligning the worlds largest economy with processes underway in regions like the UAE, where defined frameworks are already unlocking tokenized markets.If passed, these bills could open the door to wider stablecoin adoption, regulated tokenization, and on-chain financial products with full legal backing, he noted.Volatility is direction-agnosticNote that the implied volatility is direction-agnostic, meaning the expected 13 swing may not necessarily be bullish and can unfold in either direction.That said, XRP is currently exhibiting strong bullish momentum, trading over 5 higher on the day at 3, the level not seen since early February, according to CoinDesk data.XRPMarketsOmkar GodboleOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesks Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

Crypto Rallies as Pressure Mounts on Chairman Jerome PowellThe White Houses campaign for new Federal Reserve leadership amped higher over the weekend.ByStephen Alpher,Helene BraunEdited byStephen AlpherJul 14, 2025, 2:22 p.m.Pressure rises on Fed Chair Jerome Powell (Federal Reserve, modified by CoinDesk)What to know:The Trump administration has been targeting questions about the Feds 2.5 billion renovation project as a way to put more pressure on Chairman Powell to step down or as cause for his firing.Two supposed contenders for Powells replacement slammed the Fed leader over the weekend.A new Fed chair to be appointed by President Trump would surely be supportive of the White Houses continued calls for sharply lower interest rates.All things being equal, easier monetary policy tends to be good for risk assets  crypto surely among them. Bitcoin rallied to above 120,000 for the first time ever over the weekend as pressure on hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to step down or be fired amped even higher. Coincidence?To review, Jerome Powell  who rushed through 75 basis points of rate cuts prior to the 2024 election  quickly switched to a more hawkish stance following Donald Trumps election(though he did allow one more 25 basis point cut just after November), and it famously hasnt sat well with the president.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Frankly, its about breaking some heads,said former Fed Governor Kevin Warshon Fox News on Sunday. Warsh, who has been consistently touted as a leading possible replacement for Powell, added that the central banks 2.5 billion renovation project was among several examples of how the Fed has lost its way and said it was time for regime change.Also appearing on TV on Sunday and also another contender to lead a post-Powell Fed, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hasset said the presidents possible power to fire Jerome Powell is being looked into ... but certainly if theres cause, he does.The latest angle of attack against Powell is the Feds 2.5 billion renovation project. Powell is being questioned not just over the massive expense, but over whether he may have misled Congress in his testimony regarding the renovation. Office of Management and Budget(OMB)Director Russ Vought last week sent Powell a list of questions regarding the project.The Fed over the weekend created a newFAQ page on its websiteto give its side of the story.Trump doesnt ease upAdding his comments over the weekend, the president said it would be a great thing for the country if Powell were to exit.Jerome Powell has been very bad for our country, he added. We should have the lowest interest rate on Earth, and we dont. He just refuses to do it.I dont know what he knows about building, but you talk about cost overrun, Trump said of the 2.5 billion renovation. He reminded that the project was approved and began moving forward while Joe Biden was still president.Regulatory angle as wellWhile Powell has kept a publicly neutral stance towards crypto, a new Fed chair could be seen as a positive for the community even beyond what surely would be easier monetary policy.Powell, over the years, has maintained his stance that bitcoin is a competitor to gold rather than to the U.S. dollar given that people are not using it as a form of payment but rather as an investment vehicle.However, he has repeatedly called for clearer regulation, specifically around stablecoins and their risks to financial stability as the industry continued to grow more mainstream. He has also stressed the importance of consumer protections as well as concerns about debanking practices in which financial institutions are forced to cut ties with crypto firms due to the risks associated with the asset class.Federal ReserveBitcoinStephen AlpherStephen is CoinDesks managing editor for Markets.

Thats why Im concerned that too many Democrats are standing on the sidelines or standing in the way of one of the most transformative financial innovations of our time: blockchain and cryptocurrency.Blockchain and crypto are already driving job creation across the country, from data centers and fintech startups to cybersecurity firms and developers working on decentralized infrastructure. This technology means more jobs, higher wages, and more money in peoples pockets, especially in communities that have been left behind by the traditional financial system.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.The numbers dont lie. Voters overwhelmingly support integrating crypto into the American financial system. More thantwo-thirds of Americans believethere should be clearer rules and regulations for the crypto industry, rather than leaving it largely unregulated, according to multiple industry-leading public opinion polls.Andtwo-thirds believethe current global financial system favors powerful interests and not them. Democrats need to understand that voters want an alternative to the current financial system that provides them with the economic freedom that is so desperately needed. That is a winning middle class message.These numbers reflect a clear mandate for action. Yet our partys leadership has often approached crypto with skepticism or outright hostility, creating a partisan divide on an innovation that should transcend political boundaries.This misalignment became painfully evident during recent elections, with Republicans, including Donald Trump, having embraced crypto, while Democrats appeared out of touch with the technological revolution reshaping our economy. We cannot afford to cede this ground, especially when crypto and blockchain offer solutions to many of the economic challenges weve long sought to address.The Democratic Party has always stood for expanding economic opportunity and ensuring that working people arent taken advantage of by powerful financial institutions. As a lifelong entrepreneur and Virginias former governor, Ive seen how embracing innovation can open doors for workers, businesses, and families across every corner of our economy. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are no exceptionthey offer real tools to increase financial inclusion, expand access, and create good-paying jobs.This isnt just theory, it is what voters are telling us. Communities of color and younger Americans, especially young men, see real promise in crypto as a path to economic empowerment. These are core Democratic constituencies, and theyll be essential to winning back the map in 2028 and beyond. If we want to remain the party of opportunity, we have to lead the way on forward-looking regulationnot stand in the way of progress.Innovation in crypto means financial services for communities traditionally underserved by conventional banking systems, offering faster, cheaper transactions and broader access to capital. For minority communities, in particular, who have historically faced discrimination in traditional banking, crypto represents a path to financial empowerment through self-custody and consumer choice. Small businesses should not have to pay 3, 4 or 5 of their profits to companies when transactions can be done at a fraction of the cost. Crypto will create a system of payment that benefits consumers and small businesses everywhere.Now, we have a crucial opportunity to correct our course. The GENIUS Act, which now awaits action in the House, presents a framework for smart, progressive regulation positioning America as a global leader in stablecoins.Stablecoins are crypto tokens backed by U.S. dollars held in a bank that provide a cheaper and faster way of moving dollars than the dated ACH system. This legislation offers a balanced approach that both nurtures innovation, strengthens the U.S. dollar and establishes necessary guardrails.The GENIUS Acts provisions will streamline our financial system and eliminate costly fees that disproportionately affect small businesses and low-income Americans. It will mean Americans can send money to family abroad in milliseconds, for fractions of a penny, using dollar backed stablecoins like USDC on lightning-fast public blockchains like Solana. This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking policy t",

Its a common tactic for gauging regulatory feedback while keeping competitive details out of public view until a launch is ready.The move adds Grayscale to the number of growing companies lining up to take their companies public as the digital assets market heats up, with bitcoinBTC120,087.54hitting new all-time highs.Stablecoin issuer Circle(CRCL)made its public debutat the beginning of June, and the stock has surged more than 500 since then. A few weeks prior to that, stock-trading app eToro(ETOR)also made the move. Its shares are now 10 higher.While Circle and eToro hit the market during challenging macroeconomic times due to tariff discussions led by President Donald Trump, both debuted at higher valuations than anticipated, suggesting renewed interest in digital assets as U.S. legislators inch closer to clearer rules for crypto companies, especially stablecoin issuers.Grayscales proposal, in contrast, comes at a time of bullish momentum for crypto assets. The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is hitting record highs on an almost daily basis. The token is currently trading at 121,728, up 30 year-to-date, and justovertook goldas the years best-performing asset.Grayscale is one of the largest crypto asset managers. Its core products are trusts and exchange-traded funds(ETFs)such as its flagship Graysale Bitcoin Trust(GBTC)and Ethereum Trust(ETHE), both of which converted into ETFs in January last year. The two alone have a combined 24 billion of assets under management.Both have suffered heavy outflows since their conversion because the asset manager charges a higher fee for its products than competitors, making it more expensive for investors to buy and hold the product.Many, however, believe that Grayscale is one of the reasons why the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved to begin with after itwon a legal fightagainst SEC over its spot bitcoin ETF application, ultimately leading to the approval of several bitcoin ETFs.UPDATE(July 14, 13:25 UTC):Changes lead photo.UPDATE(July 14, 13:48 UTC):Adds recent IPOs in fifth paragraph, Grayscale products, background starting in eighth.FastNewsIPOBreaking NewsGrayscaleAoyon AshrafAoyon Ashraf is CoinDesks Head of Americas.

Tornado Cash Dev Roman Storms Money Laundering Trial Kicks Off MondayIf convicted on all three charges, Storm faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison.ByCheyenne LigonEdited byNikhilesh DeJul 14, 2025, 1:05 p.m.NEW YORK, New York  Tornado Cash developer Roman Storms criminal money laundering is slated to begin in Manhattan on Monday morning, when Storms lawyers and prosecutors will begin to select a jury to oversee Storms four-week trial.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the State of Crypto Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.Storm was arrested in Washington state in 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business  charges which, if Storm is convicted, carry a maximum combined sentence of 45 years in prison. Storms fellow Tornado Cash developer, Russian national Roman Semenov, faces the same charges but remains at large. Another developer, Alexey Pertsev, wasconvicted of money launderingin the Netherlands in 2024 and sentenced to five years in prison, which he iscurrently appealing.At the heart of Storms case lies Tornado Cash, a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency mixing service, which the government has alleged was used to launder over 1 billion in criminal proceeds by bad actors  including the Lazarus Group, North Koreas state-sanctioned hacking operation, which they say constituted a violation of U.S. sanctions  while Storm and his colleagues turned a blind eye. Storms lawyers, meanwhile, haveargued that he was simply a developer of open-source, decentralized softwarewith legitimate, privacy-preserving uses who should not be held responsible for bad actors use of it.Theres certainly going to be a very vigorous defense here that they were writing code and that Tornado Cash was designed for privacy  that some people may have taken advantage of it, but Storm and his colleagues werent co-conspirators, said Mark Bini, a partner in Reed Smiths global regulatory and enforcement practice group. Mixers have been very controversial because theyve been used by lots of people doing bad things, no doubt about it, but the idea that some people would want to use them for privacy, thats a legitimate argument as well. Thats going to make for a fierce battle here.Storms trial has drawn the attention of many in the crypto industry, who haveraised concernsthat, if Storm is found guilty, it could mean that developers down the line areon the hookfor how people use their programs  something that could have devastating consequences for both the availability of privacy tools and the decentralized finance(DeFi)space as a whole. A host of major players in the industry, including investment firm Paradigm, and non-profit advocacy groups Coin Center and the DeFi Education Fund, have submitted amicus briefs in Storms defense.Others, however, have been more reluctant to accept Storms privacy defense. Economics writer J.P. Koenig wrote ina 2024 blog postthat, if Storm prevails at trial, it could potentially mean that anyone who wants to facilitate illegal activities would have a strong incentive to copy Tornado Cash, effectively turning their operation into a golem  a deathless artificial being run on smart contracts  and then throwing away the keys to avoid the law.Swiss blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger wrote ina blog postthat there are, in general, far more reasons why cyber criminals might want to use a mixing service than developers who legitimately want to obfuscate the movement of their personal funds.Shifting windsStorms trial begins as the U.S. government continues to overhaul its approach to the crypto industry  particuarly crypto regulation. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the White House has taken a friendlier stance towards the industry (whichpoured a whopping 130 millioninto congressional races in the 2024 elections and at least 18 million into Trumps inaugural committee alone), nudging regulators and law enforcement to do the same.Since Trump took office in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  which had taken on a bogeyman-like status under former Chair Gary Gensler for its so-called practice of regulation by enforcement  has formed an industry-friendly Crypto Task Force and dropped a slew of open cases and investigations into crypto companies. In anApril memo to staff, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche ordered U.S. Department of Justice(DOJ)staff to narrow their focus on crypto crime, instructing them that the agency would no longer be charging regulatory violations in cases involving crypto.Though some speculated that prosecutors would back down from their case against Storm in the wake of Blanches memo,the government pressed forward, dro",

The act, if passed, could eliminate much of that uncertainty, providing a stable foundation for broader industry participation.Buy-rated Galaxy Digital and Coinbase are exceptionally well positioned to benefit from the increased institutional adoption of crypto that would likely happen once the act is passed, the report added.Read more:Digital Assets Are One Step Closer to Regulatory ClarityDisclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards.For more information, seeCoinDesks full AI Policy.Cryptocurrency RegulationsGalaxy DigitalCoinbaseBenchmarkAnalystsWill CannyWill Canny is an experienced market reporter with a demonstrated history of working in the financial services industry.

You wont want to start your day without it.By Omkar Godbole(All times ET unless indicated otherwise)The crypto market is asea of greenwith top coins extending near-vertical rallies that began over two weeks ago. BitcoinBTC120,087.54climbed above 122,000 for the first time on record, outpacing gold to become the best-performing asset in 2025.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDont miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.See all newslettersSign me upBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms of useandprivacy policy.The rally has the crypto community identifying bitcoin price targets ranging from 140,000 to 200,000. Some observers, however, cautioned against getting carried away by the bull momentum.While some analysts project 130-140K targets, history teaches us that parabolic moves often invite sharp corrections, said Marcin Kazmierczak, a co-founder of blockchain oracle Redstone. The industrys maturation is real, institutional infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and use cases are all advancing. Yet this very maturation demands we approach these milestones with professional discipline rather than euphoria.Kazmierczak noted that while the technical breakout is undeniable, the market hasnt seen a correction in over 47 days. More than 276m in leveraged positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone, reminding us that volatility remains bitcoins constant companion, he added.More caution shows in options market activity on Deribit, which suggests traders are in no rush to take bullish speculative bets. One-month risk reversals, measuring the pricing differential between bullish calls and bearish puts, are flat even as the spot price trades at record highs.By contrast, September and December risk reversals continue to show a firm bid for calls, which could indicate a preference to hedge against short-term volatility while maintaining a longer-term bullish outlook, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market update.Looking ahead, Congress so-calledCrypto Weekcould see lawmakers discuss the CLARITY Act, the GENUIS Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act. Clarity on the regulatory front could bode well for top tokens, stablecoins and, especially, tokenization. As Kazmierczak said in his analysis, the real opportunity lies not in speculative trading, but in building the infrastructure for programmable money and asset tokenization.Tuesdays U.S. inflation data is likely to show a renewed uptick in inflation in June. According to analysts, it may not matter much to crypto, which is being driven higher by factors other than Fed rate-cut odds. Nevertheless, potential dollar strength on the back of inflation data could affect the crypto market.

It is also one of the best performing in emerging markets.Mexicos high interest rates and President Claudia Sheinbaums tempered approach toward Trump have helped lure in cash from investors reallocating money away from the US. And after months of repeated delays on the implementation of tariffs, money managers have grown more complacent, with reactions to fresh announcements largely contained as they look past Trumps threats to focus on the medium-term outlook.Markets know the drill, said Marco Oviedo, a senior strategist at XP Investimentos in Sao Paulo. The only risk that I see is if the Mexican government fails to deliver something that Trump wants on drug control that might leave tariffs high for longer or negotiations in limbo.Mexicos strong economic ties to the US have also worked in the pesos favor. The US doesnt intend to apply the 30 rate to USMCA-compliant goods, a White House official said on Saturday. The administration has previously said it will keep the exemption for Canada.Although Mexican officials were taken aback by Trumps latest tariff threat, US Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson said Saturday in Mexico City that Sheinbaum and Trump have a wonderful relationship and no partnership should be easier than between their two countries.Sheinbaum said Monday during her daily press conference that her government expects to reach a tariff deal with the US before an Aug. 1 deadline and has a plan if talks fail. Shes expected to meet later today with a Mexican trade negotiating team that was in Washington on Friday discussing the issue.The countrys rate differentials are another factor helping prop up the currency. The central bank has been cautious when lowering interest rates, keeping the peso on the radar of carry traders who borrow in lower-yielding currencies to buy those that offer higher yields.After delivering a half-point cut that left the key rate at 8 last month, Governor Victoria Rodriguez embraced the likelihood of smaller reductions going forward in a July 9 speech. That helped the peso inch higher last week, outperforming as developing-world currencies slipped amid the latest barrage of tariff announcements.Story ContinuesThe rally in Mexico has gone beyond the currency. Local bonds and stocks have also gained in the wake of Trumps so-called Liberation Day on April 2 amid a positive backdrop for emerging markets as the dollar slips.The peso is trading incredibly well in the face of this, said Eric Fine, portfolio manager for emerging markets debt at Van Eck Associates. This reaction has many explanations, but EMFX and interest rates have had a great year despite tariff-dominated news flow.(Updates with additional details on USMCA, Sheinbaum comments and asset moves starting in fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOur Goal Is to Get Their Money: Inside a Firm Charged With Scamming Writers for MillionsThailands Changing Cannabis Rules Leave Farmers in a Tough SpotThe Turbulence Is Brutal: Four Shark Tank Businesses on TariffsTrumps Cuts Are Making Federal Data DisappearTrade War?

The number of shares to be registered as well as the price range have not yet been determined, the company said.Founded in 2013, Grayscale launched the first publicly-traded Bitcoin fund and the first Ethereum investment fund. The company now has more than 33 billion in assets under management and more than three dozen products, according to its website.Grayscale declined to comment, citing a regulatory quiet period due to the active filing and pointed to its press release published earlier Monday.The move comes a few months after Gemini, the crypto firm backed by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, filed confidentially for an IPO. It also comes after the frenzied debut of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group Inc. in June, further cementing crypto technologies into mainstream finance. Circles 1.1 billion IPO has been the highest-profile crypto debut since Coinbase Global Inc. went public in a 2021 direct listing.Companies typically pursue confidential IPO filings to maintain greater control over the process and limit reputational risk. This approach allows them to engage with regulators and respond to SEC feedback without public scrutiny. Publicly announcing a confidential filing, on the other hand, can serve strategic purposes such as building market momentum and gauging investor interest.Grayscale is known for being one of the key factors in getting spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved in the US. The firm, a unit of Digital Currency Group and a part of the conglomerate built by billionaire investor Barry Silbert, in 2023 scored a legal victory in federal court with its bid to turn its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into the first US ETF that would invest directly in the largest digital coin. Months later, a dozen spot-Bitcoin ETFs were launched including those by BlackRock Inc and Fidelity Investments Inc.The 21 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker GBTC) has now been eclipsed by BlackRocks iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which has three times the amount assets. Whereas GBTC has a 1.5 expense ratio, IBIT just has 0.25.Story ContinuesThis year, Bitcoin has notched multiple records  now at the 120,000 for the first time on rising investor enthusiasm as the US House of Representatives prepares to consider key industry legislation during its Crypto Week. The prospect of a clear US regulatory framework, along with Bitcoins steady advance in the face of President Donald Trumps chaotic trade policy, has bolstered confidence in the asset class among institutional investors.The company is expected to go public later this year based on typical IPO timelines, though the exact timing will depend on market conditions and remains subject to change.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOur Goal Is to Get Their Money: Inside a Firm Charged With Scamming Writers for MillionsThailands Changing Cannabis Rules Leave Farmers in a Tough SpotThe Turbulence Is Brutal: Four Shark Tank Businesses on TariffsTrumps Cuts Are Making Federal Data DisappearTrade War?

It could collapse the currency and bond markets, he says in a note seen byFortune. Polymarket puts the chances of a Powell ouster at 19. We consider the removal of Chair Powell as one of the largest under-priced event risks, Saravelos says.Deutsche Bankpublished an explosive research note over the weekend titled simply, What if ? (And yes, it includes that idiosyncratic use of extra spaces in front of the question mark.)Written by Global Head of FX Research George Saravelos, it explores what might happen if President Trump gets his way and forces Jerome Powell out of the chairmanship of the U.S. Federal Reserve in order to replace him with someone who agrees with Trump that interest rates should be lower.We believe the market reaction would be large, the note says. The empirical and academic evidence on the impact of a loss of central bank independence is fairly clear: in extreme cases, both the currency and the bond market can collapse as inflation expectations move higher, real yields drop and broader risk premia increase on the back of institutional erosion.Saravelos declined further comment when reached byFortune.The note is important because while most investors do not believe it islikelythat Trump can actually replace Powell before his term is up next May, they do not believe it isimpossible.Bettors on Polymarket, the crypto predictions exchange, currently put the chance of Powells removal at 19.Until recently, Trumps hatred of Powell was expressed mostly through angry social media posts. He has given Powell a nickname, Too Late,and said he has beenwhining like a baby about non-existent Inflation for months, and refusing to do the right thing.But last week, the threat against Powell became more real when Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget,sent Powell a letterdemanding that he answer a series of questions about the renovation of the Feds HQ.He gave Powell seven business days to replya deadline that expires on July 21.Vought alleges that Powell misled Congress when he testified recently that the renovation did not include luxurious touches such as a roof garden with a set of beehives.There are no new water features. Theres no beehives and theres no roof terrace garden,Powell said.Vought says that those elements were in the plan approved by the National Capital Planning Commission, and if Powell has changed the construction plans, then thats a violation of the National Capital Planning Act because the renovation is not following the approved plan.Story ContinuesPowellhas askedthe Inspector Generals office to reviewthe renovations.This spat over construction plans could have punishing effects on the asset markets, Saravelos said in his note.It is stating the obvious that investors would likely interpret such an event as a direct affront to Fed independence, putting the central bank under extreme institutional duress. With the Fed sitting at the pinnacle of the global dollar monetary system, it is also stating the obvious that the consequences would reverberate far beyond US borders, he wrote.Saravelos said a removal of Powell would be far worse than President Nixons imposition of Arthur Burns on the Fed in the 1970s. Nixon and Burns, like Trump, were fixated on lowering interest ratesand thus fuelled the stagflation of that decade.Today, the US is running a much larger twin deficit and negative foreign asset position, capital markets are far more open and disproportionately skewed towards US asset allocation, and the global exchange rate system is free-floating as opposed to fixed. All these ingredients argue for significantly greater global disruption than in the 1970s, Saravelos warned.The first warning sign would be a sharp fall in the value of the U.S. dollar. The greenback has already fallen 9.75 this year, its worst first-half performance in years.It is hard to quantify the impact on FX and rates, but on the first 24 hours of an announcement of a Powell removal, we would expect a drop in the trade-weighted dollar of at least 3-4 accompanied by a 30-40bps sell-off in US fixed income led by the back-end. Similar to the experience in April, we would expect the correlation between the bond market and the dollar to turn sharply positive (both down), Saravelos said.The situation would be similar to what happened in Turkiye, where President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan maintains political control of the Central Bank of Turkey.Like Trump, Erdogan has a strong dislike for high interest rates and, as a result, the inflation rate in Turkiye is currently 35.In sum, we consider the removal of Chair Powell as one of the largest under-priced ",

That includes a record 2.2 billion over the past two days, the largest two-day net inflow on record, according to data from Farside Investors.At the same time, open interest in bitcoin futures rose to a record 57.4 billion as of Friday, data from CoinDesk shows.Open interest tracks the total value of outstanding futures contracts, and a sustained rise often points to greater institutional involvement, as larger investors tend to hold bigger, longer-term positions and use futures for hedging.Yet, funding rates in the futures market remain subdued. According to CoinDesk, the annualised funding rate stood at 10, well below the 80 peaks of 2023 and 40 at the end of last year.The funding rate reflects the cost traders pay to keep bullish, leveraged bets open in the futures market. A decline signals theyre less willing to pay to stay in those positions  a sign of reduced speculative demand.Glassnode data shows bitcoins estimated leverage ratio has declined to 0.25, down from 0.32 at the start of 2025.The leverage ratio compares how large traders futures bets are relative to the amount of bitcoin on exchanges. A lower ratio means those bets are backed by more real capital and less borrowed money.Glassnode data also showed an increase in short liquidations as traders betting against bitcoin bought back the token as prices rose, adding momentum to the rally.(Reporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy in BengaluruEditing by Vidya Ranganathan and Jane Merriman)TermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore Info",

Year-to-date through Friday, only gold  up 27.7  has outperformed bitcoin, up 25.9. By comparison, the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 index has gained 8.7, while the broad SP 500 has climbed 7.Early Monday morning, the nearly 20 million individual bitcoins in existence are worth a combined 2.4 trillion, making the entire asset class the worlds fifth-most valuable, surpassing Amazon and closing in on Apple,according to crypto news site CoinTelegraph.com. Apple had a 3.1 trillion market valuation as of Monday morning.Most of this years gains have come in the past few weeks. Theyve been fueled by a host of factors, including the partial pause in President Donald Trumps trade war and the passage of his tax cut and spending bill, which, on balance, cuts taxes while also increases the U.S.s debt  both bullish for increased bitcoin investment.The dollars declining value relative to other currencieshas also made bitcoin a more attractive asset to own as a hedge among international investors against potential changes to the dollars status as reserve currency.Finally, theres beenincreased interest among large financial firms in crypto thanks in part to crypto-focused legislation.Indeed, the GOP-led House of Representatives has declared this week crypto week as it takes up three different bills related to regulating digital assets, including the GENIUS Act, which would clarify how companies can issue their own digital tokens.According to Reuters, Democrats  many of whom remain opposed to making crypto more mainstream  are expected to offer several amendments to the bills, though it was unclear whether any would be successful.Cryptos recent uplift has added some 620 million to Trumps estimated net worth,Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Some Democrats see those gains as reason enough to oppose legislation that would pave the way for wider crypto adoption.These bills would make Congress complicit in Trumps unprecedented crypto scam,Rep. Maxine Watersof California, the top Democrat on the House financial services committee, said in a statement.Theres debate about how much higher bitcoin will go the rest of the year. Its trajectory remains strongly tied to the outlook for global interest rates. When these are relatively lower  as they have been recently  theres more money available to purchase riskier assets like bitcoin.But with developed economies that have historically kept government spending in checknow set to increase funding, interest rates are likely to begin ramping up in response to inflation concerns,The risk that central banks shift focus back to the risks of re-accelerating inflation may develop into a potential headwind for Bitcoin in the latter half of the year, Matthew Weller, global head of research at FOREX.com, said in a note published earlier this month, especially with fiscal policy (government spending and tax cuts) becoming more accommodative.Rob WileRob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.",
