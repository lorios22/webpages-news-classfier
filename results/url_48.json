These developments signal a shift in how businesses and governments view BTC, moving it closer to mainstream acceptance. 26 U.S. States Explore Bitcoin Reserves Across the United States, 26 states have introduced bills to establish Bitcoin reserves, targeting up to 10% of state funds for BTC. Wisconsin set the pace in late 2024, buying $588 million in Bitcoin ETFs. Now, states like Texas and Oklahoma are advancing similar plans, with Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB1203) gaining attention after the House passed it with a 77-15 vote on March 24, 2025, according to the Oklahoma House of Representatives . Progress isn’t uniform, though. Five states, including Montana, have rejected such proposals. Still, if these bills pass, states could collectively pour billions into Bitcoin, highlighting cryptocurrency growth as a public finance strategy. GameStop Makes Bold Bitcoin Debut On March 25, 2025, GameStop announced its first move into Bitcoin, planning to add it to its corporate treasury. With $4.8 billion in cash, the video game retailer aims to diversify its assets after closing 590 stores last year. Its Q4 2024 earnings showed a doubled net income of $131.3 million, giving it room to experiment. This marks a significant step in corporate crypto investment, distinct from repeat players like Strategy. Risks remain. Bitcoin’s volatility could impact GameStop’s finances, as its SEC filing warns. However, this debut has sparked buzz, positioning the company as a new contender in the BTC space. Strategy Continues Its Bitcoin Push Strategy, a well-known Bitcoin accumulator, holds 506,137 BTC as of March 24, 2025, per its latest filing. This follows a recent purchase of 6,911 BTC, funded by a $711.2 million share sale. While its holdings—over 2.4% of Bitcoin’s supply—are notable, this is business as usual for the firm, unlike GameStop’s fresh entry. Since President Trump’s January 2025 inauguration, Strategy has ramped up acquisitions, aligning with his pro-crypto stance, including the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Bitcoin’s price, now at $87,000 after topping $100,000 post-election, reflects this supportive climate. A Broader Shift in Play These moves point to Bitcoin adoption gaining traction. For example, if 26 states collectively buy 200,000 BTC—a conservative estimate based on varying state budgets—that’s $17.4 billion in potential investment at current prices. GameStop’s entry adds a new corporate angle, while Strategy’s steady growth reinforces the trend. Together, they could tighten BTC supply, though volatility and legislative delays pose challenges. Why Hasn’t Bitcoin’s Price Soared? Despite this news, Bitcoin hasn’t crossed $100,000 again, trading at $87,000 after peaking above $108,000 in January. A key reason may be that the impact of these developments is overstated. While 26 states proposing Bitcoin reserves sounds significant, these bills are in early stages, with five states already rejecting similar plans. GameStop’s entry is fresh, but its investment scale remains unclear. Strategy’s 506,137 BTC holding, though impressive, continues an existing strategy, not a new catalyst. Even the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, holding an estimated 200,000 BTC from criminal seizures, hasn’t spurred immediate price action—possibly because the market expected more aggressive buying or regulatory clarity that hasn’t arrived. Other factors also weigh in. A 20% correction followed January’s high, driven by trade war fears from Trump’s tariff threats and economic slowdown (U.S. GDP growth at 1.7%). Bearish sentiment, and technical breakdowns below the $90,000 support level further cap gains. Analysts suggest a potential rebound by mid-2025 if adoption grows. For readers tracking global trends, this offers a glimpse into BTC’s evolving role. Perhaps regional companies in places like the UAE could take note and explore similar steps. * Read our disclaimer Tags Bitcoin adoption  bitcoin reserves  GameStop      Share  Facebook  X  LinkedIn    Messenger      Share via Email  Print",
