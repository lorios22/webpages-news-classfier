The only index of its kind, the STAX is a proprietary, behavior-based index that analyzes retail investor stock positions and trading activity from Schwab’s millions of client accounts to illuminate what investors were actually doing and how they were positioned in the markets each month.           The reading for the four-week period ending December 27, 2024, ranks \"moderate low\" compared to historic averages.     \"Schwab clients increased their exposure to equities in December, even as major indices experienced atypical swings and turbulence,\" said Joe Mazzola, Head Trading & Derivatives Strategist at Charles Schwab. \"We didn’t see a significant ‘Santa Claus Rally’ this year, but investor sentiment appeared bullish, particularly at the start and end of the month. Many clients appeared to close out the year by rebalancing their portfolios, adding exposure to underperforming sectors such as Health Care and Energy and trimming positions in outperformers like Information Technology and Communication Services.\"           U.S. equity markets hovered near their recent all-time highs for the first half of the December period as a muted CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) traded near 14, belying what was to come.     The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its Employment Situation Summary on December 6, which showed that non-farm payrolls rose by 227,000, more than anticipated, and the unemployment rate (4.2%) ticked higher, in line with expectations. The S&P 500’s reaction was muted, trading down slightly the following day. On December 11, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in as expected at 2.7% for the trailing 12 months, including a 0.3% monthly increase. On December 12, an increase in the Producer Price Index (PPI) was reported as unexpectedly hot at 0.4%. Equity markets largely shrugged this off while the yield on the 10-year Treasury Note rose by 1.73% to 4.399%.            While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement on December 18 did not suggest a major pivot, the Committee’s 2025 outlook postulated that markets may have fewer interest rate cuts to look forward to than had been previously expected. This set off a tantrum that played out in the markets through the remainder of the period, with major indices selling off hard and the VIX spiking above 27. The 2.9% drop in the S&P 500 was its largest since August 5th and represented only the third time the index closed 2% or lower since February 21st, 2023. The S&P 500 did finish moderately lower on the month, by about 1%, though it did manage to finish 24% higher on the year and generate back-to-back years of annual returns greater than 20% for the first time since 1998.  Story Continues  Terms  and  Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard           Best Bitcoin ETFs: Top funds for buying Bitcoin  James Royal, Ph.D.  Tue, July 8, 2025 at 9:21 AM GMT-3  4 min read  In This Article :   BTC-USD ETH-USD IBIT MCD        The best Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) make it easy and cheap to buy and sell the cryptocurrency through a traditional online broker rather than through the potentially riskier process of using a cryptocurrency exchange.     Spot Bitcoin ETFs , available since early 2024, also give traders a way to access Bitcoin without having to take custody of the crypto coin themselves. Spot Ethereum ETFs offer the same perks for investors looking for exposure to the second most popular currency too. ( Here are the best Ethereum ETFs. )     Here are some of the best Bitcoin ETFs, including how much you’ll pay to invest in them.     Top Bitcoin ETFs     Bitcoin ETFs are generally available at any broker that allows customers to purchase stocks on a major U.S. exchange. The best brokers for stock trading allow you to buy any available ETF with no commission, so you can get in and out of a position at a low cost.     Fund (ticker) Total assets 1-year performance Expense ratio  VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) $1.65 billion 80.85% — iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) $73.6 billion 80.57% 0.12% Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) $4.8 billion N/A 0.15% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (BITB) $4.4 billion 80.52% 0.20% ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) $5.2 billion 80.42% 0.21% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) $22.05 billion 80.54% 0.25%     Source: etf.com. Data as of July 7, 2025     Spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of the crypto on effectively the same percentage basis, even if they trade at different prices. If Bitcoin rises 1 percent, then the fund should rise 1 percent. So you see that the spot funds have all risen approximately the same amount, with minor differences.           Which fund should you choose? If you were looking at two McDonald’s on the same block and they both offered Big Macs, it would make sense to go with the cheaper one. Since these funds give you exposure to Bitcoin in the same way, their defining feature is their expense ratio , the percentage of your investment that they charge as a fee.     Some Bitcoin funds initially charged 0 percent fees as they pursued a “land grab” and looked to grow their assets and users quickly. With the top funds now holding billions of dollars, those fees have largely reverted.           A few funds may eventually become dominant and be able to lower their fees still more, and so draw in more investors, enabling them to lower prices even further and become more dominant.      The funds’ expense ratios are competitive with the fees for trading Bitcoin in all but the cheapest brokers and exchanges for cryptocurrency trading . So , these Bitcoin funds can be a good option to keep your overall costs low while making it easy to trade from your existing online broker.
