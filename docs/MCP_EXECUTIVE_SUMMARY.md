## üèóÔ∏è MCP Architecture Overview

### **What is MCP?**
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an architectural pattern that centralizes external API calls and provides standardized interfaces for different services. Instead of scattered API calls throughout the codebase, all external communications go through specialized MCP tools.

### **Our Implementation**
```
Before MCP: App ‚Üí Direct API Calls ‚Üí External Services
After MCP:  App ‚Üí MCP Tools ‚Üí Centralized API Management ‚Üí External Services
```

### **Benefits Realized**
1. **Centralized Management:** All API keys and configurations in one place
2. **Rate Limiting:** Intelligent throttling prevents API limit breaches
3. **Health Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of all external services
4. **Easy Switching:** Can change API providers without code changes
5. **Cost Control:** Better tracking and optimization of API usage

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### **Gradual Implementation**
Our MCP integration followed a **zero-disruption migration strategy:**

1. **Phase 1:** Built MCP tools alongside existing code
2. **Phase 2:** Created API adapter for seamless switching
3. **Phase 3:** Gradual migration with fallback mechanisms
4. **Phase 4:** Full MCP deployment with monitoring

### **Risk Mitigation**
